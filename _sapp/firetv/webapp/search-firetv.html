        "content": "This page discusses the concepts and terminology related to implementing accessibility features for Fire OS. Note: Before you begin, Amazon recommends reading through the Android documentation for accessibility to familiarize yourself with these terms and concepts. See Making Applications Accessible.  Overview of Fire OS Accessibility Objects and Events          AccessibilityEvent      AccessibilityNodeInfo      AccessibilityNodeProvider      AccessibilityDelegate        Path of an Accessibility Event          Standard Views      Custom Views        Setting a view’s importance  Managing an AccessibilityNodeInfo Object  Implementing Virtually Accessible Descendants          Creating Virtually Accessible Descendant Views      Management of a Virtually Accessible Descendant view        Best Practices for Fire OS Accessibility  Related ResourcesOverview of Fire OS Accessibility Objects and EventsThis section contains an introduction to the terms and their definitions for the objects and events that you will use when implementing accessibility in your app.AccessibilityEventAn AccessibilityEvent is a message from an application to an assistive technology indicating that something happened in the UI. Examples of UI changes that could trigger an accessibility event include focus changes, a window appearing or disappearing, or an on-screen object changing locations.Also see the Android documentation for AccessibilityEvents.AccessibilityNodeInfoAn AccessibilityNodeInfo is a snapshot of the accessibility information related to an on-screen component and provides mostly one-way communication between your app and the assistive technology. The assistive technology also has very limited communication back to the app via accessibility actions.After your application creates and returns an AccessibilityNodeInfo, the assistive technology and accessibility framework will not see any further changes to that node, so at that point you can discard the node. If the underlying object represented by the node changes, send an appropriate accessibility event indicating the change, reflecting the updated characteristics of the object in the node returned from the next call to either createAccessibilityNodeInfo or onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo.In the app, on the server side, reference nodes using a combination of an Android view and a virtual descendant number. If the node represents the view itself, the virtual descendant number is -1 (AccessibilityNodeProvider.HOST_VIEW_ID).An app can add descriptive information about an AccessibilityNodeInfo object in that object’s getExtras Bundle, which VoiceView can read by calling AccessibilityNodeInfo.getExtras().Also see the Android documentation for AccessibilityNodeInfo.AccessibilityNodeProviderAn AccessibilityNodeProvider is an interface which creates an AccessibilityNodeInfo either for a view or for the virtually accessible descendant of a view.Also see the Android documentation for AccessibilityNodeProvider.AccessibilityDelegateAn AccessibilityDelegate  is an interface that can initialize accessibility events, nodes for views, or virtual accessible descendants. Use AccessibilityDelegates to proxy or augment accessibility information in one view from information in another. For example, a parent list can provide accessibility information for a list item.Also see the Android documentation for AccessibilityDelegate.Path of an Accessibility Event This section discusses the path of accessibility events for standard and custom views.Standard ViewsThe visual elements that make up the user interface of a Fire OS app are called Views. For example consider a simple app that has a single text element, a TextView with the text “hello world”. In this example, the TextView is a child of a RelativeLayout. RelativeLayout is a child of ViewRootImpl, the class that is always the root of an app’s View hierarchy. Since a TextView is a standard Android view, the default behavior of the TextView is to send appropriate accessibility events when VoiceView is running.The following process describes the path of an accessibility event created within this simple app:   The app’s code calls textView.setText(\"new text\") a few seconds after the app opens.  The TextView creates a TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED AccessibilityEvent and requests that its parent, the RelativeLayout, send the event.  The RelativeLayout then passes the event up to its parent, the ViewRootImpl, and requests that it send the event to the framework.  The ViewRootImpl sends the event to the Accessibility Framework by calling the AccessibilityManager’s sendAccessibilityEvent().  The AccessibilityManager passes the event to the AccessibilityManagerService, which then passes the event out of the Accessibility Framework and into VoiceView.  When VoiceView processes the TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED AccessibilityEvent, it calls the event object’s getSource() method.  This will trigger the Accessibility Framework to call the TextView's createAccessibilityNodeInfo() method, which returns an AccessibilityNodeInfo object containing the text “new text”.  The Accessibility Framework then passes the AccessibilityNodeInfo object to VoiceView.  Finally, VoiceView becomes aware of the TextView’s change from “hello world” to “new text”, and if a customer uses linear navigation to hear the text of the TextView, VoiceView will correctly speak “new text”.Custom ViewsIf your app uses a custom view instead of a standard view, you must uphold this pattern of informing VoiceView of the state of your widget. When doing so, do not try to send an AccessibilityNodeInfo object to VoiceView, or update a local copy of the AccessibilityNodeInfo in your app; these approaches will not work.Remember, when you change the state of a custom widget:DO  Send an AccessibilityEvent by calling requestSendAccessibilityEvent() on your custom view’s parent.  Ensure the variables pointed to in your custom view’s createAccessibilityNodeInfo() function contain updated values. VoiceView calls createAccessibilityNodeInfo() when VoiceView receives your AccessibilityEvent.DO NOT  Try to send an AccessibilityNodeInfo to VoiceView.  Keep references to AccessibilityNodeInfo objects outside of your createAccessibilityNodeInfo() function and then update these objects. VoiceView does not have any way to reference to these objects and will never see your updates to them.In the Android documentation, be sure to review a code example demonstrating correct use of the AccessibilityDelegate and AccessibilityNodeProvider classes where the createAccessibilityNodeInfo() function is implemented.Setting a view’s importanceTo ensure that accessibility events are handled properly, make sure to set the importance for accessibility for each Android view. Set the state of view’s importance for accessibility either in an XML layout with the android:importantForAccessibility attribute or programmatically with the View.setImportantForAccessibility method. You can set importance to yes, no, no_hide_descendants, or auto (default). Views that are not tagged as important do not have corresponding accessibility nodes, and additionally, the framework drops any accessibility events sent by them.If your view is sending appropriate accessibility events, but VoiceView doesn’t seem to be responding correctly, verify that your view is tagged as important for accessibility.Managing an AccessibilityNodeInfo ObjectOne important aspect of Fire OS and Android accessibility is the management of AccessibilityNodeInfo objects. When the Android accessibility framework, which runs in the app’s process, receives a request for a particular node, the framework first checks to see if the node is in its cache:  If the node exists in the cache, it is returned, and no call to create the node is made to the app. Because of this, your app must diligently notify the framework and assistive technologies whenever the accessibility information about a component changes. Otherwise, the framework returns stale information to the assistive technologies.  To indicate that a node has changed and is no longer valid, send an accessibility event of type AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED.  If the node is not already in the cache depends, the node could be created, depending on how it was requested. Several possible actions by the assistive technology can trigger the creation of an AccessibilityNodeInfo object:          Receiving an accessibility event, and requesting its source.      Requesting the root node of the active window.      Requesting the parent or child node of a particular node.      Implementing Virtually Accessible DescendantsThis section discusses how to implement virtually accessible descendant views.Creating Virtually Accessible Descendant ViewsBoth AccessibilityDelegate and AccessibilityNodeProvider can provide accessibility for on-screen components that are not represented by backing views. An example of such a component is the AOSP on-screen keyboard whose keys are drawn on a canvas. Note that when implementing a virtual node tree, the ExploreByTouchHelper support library provided by Android might not work as expected.Apps reference AccessibilityNodeInfo objects in by the view hosting the node and a virtual view ID. A virtual view ID of -1 (AccessibilityNodeProvider.HOST_VIEW_ID) references the host view itself. When creating nodes, you can add virtual children using the AccessibilityNodeInfo.addChild() method and specifying both the host view and the virtual view ID of the virtual child. Similarly, when creating child nodes, you can set a virtual parent by specifying the host view and the parent virtual view ID in the call to AccessibilityNodeInfo.setParent().Management of a Virtually Accessible Descendant viewWhen you initially create virtual views, they are only referenced by their IDs and have no associated accessibility information (text, content description, etc.). When the accessibility framework requests that your app create the appropriate node, input the corresponding accessibility information into the AccessibilityNodeInfo. As a result, make sure that your app tracks which virtual view ID represents which portion of your custom widget.Add the IDs of the child or parent nodes, and the framework later requests that your application actually create those nodes. Do not simply add child nodes to a container node.Best Practices for Fire OS AccessibilityTo ensure the best user experience for apps with accessibility features, follow these guidelines:  AccessibilityNodeInfo text: The text of an AccessibilityNodeInfo should only return the on-screen text of an object.  Labels for onscreen items: All important onscreen items should have labels. Make sure that when testing with VoiceView, you touch all onscreen items and that you hear an appropriate description read. If a description is missing, add the appropriate text or content description to the item’s AccessibilityNodeInfo.  Content descriptions: Use the content description for items that do not have on-screen text (for example, alt text for an image), or to augment the on-screen text to provide additional context to the user. However, avoid putting too much content into the content description to avoid overwhelming the user.  Accessibility event usage: Avoid using the AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_ANNOUNCEMENT event type to convey on-screen activity. Preferably, use a combination of accessibility events and corresponding changes to the AccessibilityNodeInfo to communicate information about on-screen changes.Related Resources  Understanding assistive Technologies for Fire OS  Implementing Future VoiceView Accessibility Features",

Alternatively, you can hold down the power button until the power dialog appears, then press and hold two fingers to the screen.To use VoiceView on a Fire Tablet:  Touch an item on the screen to move the VoiceView cursor to that item.          When an item has VoiceView’s focus, a green rectangle will appear, surrounding the item.      When a user moves the VoiceView cursor to an item, VoiceView speaks the item’s description.        Double-tap anywhere on the screen to activate the item in the focus of the VoiceView cursor. ORInstead of touching items to move the VoiceView cursor, you can move sequentially through all items on the screen by swiping right to move to the next item, and swiping left to move to the previous item.Activating VoiceView on Fire TVTo activate VoiceView on Fire TV:      Enable VoiceView by holding down the Back and Menu keys on the Fire TV remote for 2 seconds.    VoiceView has two navigation modes available: Standard Navigation Mode or Enhanced Navigation Mode. You can switch to Standard Navigation Mode by holding down the Menu key. Note that in Standard Navigation Mode, VoiceView’s cursor will only move among actionable items, such as buttons.         In Enhanced Navigation Mode, press the Right and Left directional keys on the remote  to move VoiceView’s cursor, shown as the green focus rectangle, to an item.         Press the Select key to activate an item.     Note: Left and Right move the cursor in an order that is logically, not visually, determined.  For example, they will move the cursor to the next and previous items in a list, regardless of whether that list is displayed horizontally or vertically. Enhanced Mode also allows access to reach items you cannot reach otherwise such as descriptive text that is not actionable.  Activating the Screen Magnifier on Fire TabletsNote that the Screen Magnifier is not currently available on Fire TV. To activate the Screen Magnifier on Fire Tablets:  With the screen magnifier enabled, triple-tap with one finger to show an enlarged view of the screen.  Pan around the screen by dragging two fingers.  Triple-tap with one finger to exit the enlarged view of the screen.Differences between VoiceView on Fire OS and TalkBack on AndroidWhile Fire OS’s VoiceView and Android’s TalkBack are both accessibility services that interact with the Android accessibility framework, VoiceView is a completely distinct screen reader from TalkBack, as opposed to a modification of TalkBack.  This section discusses the differences between these two accessibility services:  Focus behavior in new windows: When a new window opens, VoiceView always places accessibility focus somewhere onscreen.  TalkBack does not place focus anywhere on a new window, and instead waits for the user to touch the screen and places focus at that location.  Linear navigation across windows: VoiceView allows linear navigation across window boundaries, while TalkBack does not.  Consider the bottom navigation bar on a tablet, which is actually a window that contains three buttons.          In VoiceView, swiping left will move the cursor to the last item in the main content window.      In TalkBack, swiping left from the Back button in the bottom navigation bar on TalkBack will not allow you to linearly navigate out of the bottom navigation bar and will produce an “end” earcon.        Granular navigation across objects: VoiceView allows granular navigation across objects, while TalkBack does not.  Consider a screen containing three objects with titles “Cat, “Dog”, and “Monkey”.          When navigating by word, VoiceView moves seamlessly from “Cat” to “Dog” to “Monkey”.      Conversely, TalkBack will stop on “Dog” and not navigate to the next word.      Similarly, when navigating by character, if you swipe down to move to the next character after landing on the “g” of “Dog”, VoiceView will move to the “C” of “Cat”. TalkBack plays a sound indicating the end of text in this case.            Text navigation: When navigating through text, VoiceView announces the character or word after the caret, TalkBack announces the character or word that the caret has passed over.  Note that VoiceView’s behavior is consistent with the behavior of screen readers on the Windows platform, which is the platform with which most blind users are familiar.    Sorting on-screen objects: TalkBack typically sorts on-screen objects in a left to right, top to bottom order, based on the coordinates of the objects’ top-left corners. VoiceView typically sorts on-screen objects in a left to right, top to bottom order, based on the coordinates of the objects’ centers.Related Resources  Implementing Future VoiceView Accessibility Features  Implementing Accessibility in Fire OS",

        "content": "The VoiceView accessibility feature of Fire OS enables vision-impaired users to navigate the Fire TV user interface. With VoiceView, visually impaired users are able to use the Up, Down, Left, and Right buttons on the remote to move the input focus around the screen.When the focus changes, VoiceView speaks the currently focused item. This functionality is similar to the “Standard Navigation” mode of the previous version of VoiceView.This page discusses the user experience (UX) recommendations for implementing VoiceView in your app.  Checklist for VoiceView Implementation          Technical Implementation Recommendations      User Experience (UX) Recommendations        Overview of VoiceView Behavior          Using the Menu button with VoiceView      Navigating with VoiceView        Navigating with Review Mode          Using Review Mode with WebViews      Navigating Focus Granularity Options in Review Mode        Implementing VoiceView          Implementing VoiceView for Static or Non-focusable Content      Implementing VoiceView for Orientation Text      Implementing VoiceView for Usage Hints        Related ResourcesChecklist for VoiceView ImplementationUse the following checklists to ensure that your Fire TV app implements the VoiceView screen reader to meet the standards recommended by Amazon for the upcoming Fire TV software release.Technical Implementation RecommendationsYour app should implement the following aspects of VoiceView:  Verify that your app’s UI is compatible with the Android Accessibility Framework.  Implement Content Descriptions so that VoiceView can read descriptions for images, buttons, and other on-screen objects.  Add Usage Hints to list and grid content so that VoiceView can help guide the interactions of vision-impaired users.  Implement Described By for static content, so that VoiceView can read that content when the associated object gains focus.User Experience (UX) RecommendationsYour app should implement the following UX recommendations for VoiceView:  VoiceView reads the content for items that gain focus, including all information that is visually represented onscreen, such as a title or episode number.  VoiceView reads Orientation Text and Usage Hints to help users learn how to navigate the screen UI.  VoiceView reads static content either automatically through Described By text, manually when a user either presses the Menu button, or manually when a user enters Review Mode and steps through on-screen items.  VoiceView reads setup information, including activation URLs and codes.  VoiceView supports features and tasks such as program selection, program information, playback, and CC settings.Overview of VoiceView BehaviorUsers can navigate the Fire TV user interface and VoiceView-enabled apps using the Menu button and other controls.Using the Menu button with VoiceViewUse the following conventions for the Menu button when VoiceView is enabled:  To enable or disable VoiceView, press the Back and Menu buttons at the same time for two seconds.  When VoiceView is enabled, VoiceView controls the Menu button and the Play/Pause button (when VoiceView is speaking).  The system or app receives double-press events from the Menu button.  Single-pressing the Menu button initiates the reading of information from the screen in the following order:          Usage hints      Orientation text      Described By text      All other static content      Navigating with VoiceViewUse the following navigation conventions when VoiceView is enabled:  When VoiceView reads Usage hints, Orientation text, Described By text, and all other static content, the user can control navigation using the Rewind and Fast Forward buttons.  When a user accesses a screen for the first time, VoiceView automatically reads the Orientation text first.  When a user moves focus to a control after pausing, VoiceView reads Usage hints and Described by text.  When speaking, the Play/Pause button silences VoiceView.          If a movie or music is playing and VoiceView is speaking, pressing Play/Pause one time silences VoiceView.      After VoiceView is silenced, pressing Play/Pause a second time pauses the playing media.        VoiceView only reads static content not marked as Described By text when a user presses the Menu button.Navigating with Review ModeVoiceView’s Review Mode allows a user to explore the grid layout of a Fire TV screen in detail, similarly to using linear navigation with a screen reader on a tablet. Use the following conventions for using Review Mode in your app:  Press-and-hold the Menu button to enter Review Mode, which will be announced by VoiceView.  The Left and Right buttons on the directional controller control linear navigation.  If a user presses Select when a non-actionable item is in focus, VoiceView speaks “Item not selectable.”  Press-and-hold the Menu button a second time to exit Review Mode.  After exiting Review Mode, the focus for accessibility returns to the previous cached location of keyboard focus, and VoiceView repeats an announcement of that focus.Using Review Mode with WebViewsA WebView can represent a complex UI within an application, containing both actionable items, such as links, and non-actionable items, such as static text and images. VoiceView supports WebViews because they are frequently used by many apps in the Amazon Appstore. In a VoiceView-enabled WebView, a user can use Review Mode to be able to navigate through the actionable items and gauge the context of the static content items. Note that Described By content is not available in WebViews.Navigating Focus Granularity Options in Review ModeWhen you first enable Review Mode, the level of granularity defaults to moving by individual controls. Press Up or Down to cycle through the available granularity options, such as character, word, control, or window. Granularity options in web content include link, list, or heading. Use the following conventions to navigate the various granularity options:  Press Left to return to the previous item at the currently selected granularity.  Press Right to move to the next item.  The granularity level is reset to “control” when you enter Review Mode.Implementing VoiceViewThis section discusses guidelines for implementing VoiceView for the following types of content:  Static/non-focusable content  Orientation text  Usage hintsImplementing VoiceView for Static or Non-focusable ContentVoiceView has implemented a separate navigation scheme for static or non-focusable content, which enables vision-impaired users to easily navigate this type of content using the Menu, Fast Forward, and Rewind buttons. Additionally, VoiceView supports markup that apps can use to associate static content with a selectable item.To associate a piece or container of static content with an item:  Set the key for com.amazon.accessibility.describedBy in the extras bundle from the AccessibilityNodeInfo for the item.      Set the value to be a string containing a space-delimited list of the view Ids of the containers or views which contain the description of this item.    When VoiceView encounters an item with the com.amazon.accessibility.describedBy key set, it will request a list of AccessibilityNodeInfo objects for the view Ids specified by the com.amazon.accessibility.describedBy value. VoiceView then reads the appropriate text or content descriptions, depending on your verbosity settings.  The following examples explain how a user would navigate static content in two different scenarios:Example 1: Consider a Fire TV movie details view where the movie title, year, duration, star ratings, etc. are all static content. The user presses Menu to prompt VoiceView to speak this content. The user then navigates using the Fast Forward and Rewind buttons.Example 2: Consider a Fire TV launcher screen that is used to navigate a movie catalogue. The text at the top of the screen updates to show the title, description, rating, and other information. Because this non-focusable content updates each time that the user selects a movie, the node containing the selected movie should be described by with the describedBy extra.Implementing VoiceView for Orientation TextTo help new users understand how Fire TV screens are laid out, VoiceView supports Orientation Text. The key for the com.amazon.accessibility.orientationText extra configures theOrientation Text for an AccessibilityNodeInfo.  The first time a user encounters an AccessibilityNodeInfo, VoiceView reads the text.  On subsequent visits, users can request context information by pressing the Menu button, which causes VoiceView to read the Orientation Text.Example: The first time a user lands on the main Fire TV home page, VoiceView reads, “Launcher. Use left and right to move between items on menus. Then use up and down to move between categories such as New Releases or Action Movies. Use left and right to move between items in the category.” Implementing VoiceView for Usage HintsFor users without visual impairment, the layout of a screen provides visual cues as to how to navigate and interact with that screen. For example, if item A is located above item B on a screen, the user might intuitively know to press the Down button to navigate from A to B. However, visually impaired users might require additional hints to aid their interactions with a screen. To help with this issue, VoiceView supports a set of extras that define Usage Hints to help with navigation within a screen:KeyValueExamplecom.amazon.accessibility.usageHint.remote(Fire TV only)String describing how to use or navigate the item using a remote.\"Press left and right to find an item.\"com.amazon.accessibility.usageHint.touch(Fire Tablets only)Description of how to interact with an item using a touch screen.\"Double tap to select. Double tap and hold for options.\"Example: Consider a screen with a multi-row grid of content, and the first of those rows is in focus, for example “Customers Also Watched”. In this case, use com.amazon.accessibility.usageHint.remote with the text such as “Press Left and Right to find an item, press Up and Down to move between collections of items.”Related Resources  Understanding assistive Technologies for Fire OS  Implementing Accessibility in Fire OS",

        "title": "Game Controller Input",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Amazon Fire TV game controllers (as well as other controllers that conform to the Bluetooth HID gamepad profile) have specific buttons, Android motion, and key event constants. Use this information tocapture input events in your app.For guidelines on button behavior for all supported controllers, see Controller Behavior Guidelines. For information on handling input for Amazon Fire TV remote controls, see Amazon Fire TV Remote Input.  Buttons  Capturing Input  Primary and Secondary Input Events  Input Event ReferenceButtonsThe Amazon Fire TV (2nd Generation) Game Controller has these buttons:The Amazon Fire TV (1st Generation) Game Controller has these buttons:Capturing InputGame controllers used with Amazon Fire TV generate Android KeyEvent events for digital button presses (such as the A button), and MotionEvent events for analog control movement (such as a joystick action).You can handle simple button input with standard Android event listener interfaces and callbacks (onClick(), onFocusChange(), and so on).To capture specific button press events in your View, override input event handlers such as onKeyDown().Test for the input constants from the KeyEvent class to capture specific keys. For example, to capture a press from the A button, use this code:@Overridepublic boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event){    boolean handled = false;    switch (keyCode){        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BUTTON_A:                // ... handle selections                handled = true;                break;     }     return handled || super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);}To capture motion events, override the onGenericMotionEvent() event in your View. Use the input constants from the MotionEvent class to determine which control generated the movement, and the events in the MotionEvent class such as getAxisValue() to determine the values for the motion:@Overridepublic boolean onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent event){    // get changes in value from left joystick    float deltaX = event.getAxisValue(MotionEvent.AXIS_X);    float deltaY = event.getAxisValue(MotionEvent.AXIS_Y);    if (deltaX &gt; 0.5 &amp;&amp; deltaY &gt; 0.5) {        // do something        handled = true;    }    return handled || super.onGenericMotionEvent(event);}Primary and Secondary Input EventsSome game controller actions on Fire TV devices may raise more than one input event for a single action. For example, the D-Pad on the Amazon Fire TV game controller is an analog directional control (producing motion events), but a digital control on the Fire TV remote controls (producing key events).Similarly, the selection action is the A button on a game controller, but it is the D-Pad center button on Fire TV remotes. Some game controller actions on Amazon Fire TV first raise a primary input event (usually a motion event). Then, if those events are not handled by your app, they raise a second input event (usually a key event). Both of the primary and secondary input events are listed in the Input Event Reference table below.Secondary input events can help you simplify the process of handling game controller input. If your app is interested only in button and D-Pad events from a game controller, the secondary events enable you to ignore motion events altogether and only deal with key events.Similarly, because the A button generates both KEYCODE_BUTTON_A and KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER, if your app supports the center D-Pad button on the Fire TV remotes, you do not have to also test for the A button.Note that your app may behave as if it is receiving double input if you do not properly handle the primary input events. Make sure your input event handlers return true if you have captured and handled an event. The secondary input event is not generated if the first has been captured.Input Event ReferenceThe following table describes the motion and key event constants for each game controller button, the suggested user experience behavior for those buttons, and the default behavior of those buttons in Amazon Fire TV user interface.Digital buttons report key events (KeyEvent), and analog controls report motion events (MotionEvent). See controller-behavior-guidelines for information on suggested behavior for controller input in your app. Note: Do not capture or throw away input events for any buttons you do not use in your app. Allowing the system to handle unused events enables background behavior such as media playback and volume control.The events listed in the Secondary Event column are raised in addition to the events in the MotionEvent or KeyEvent columns, if your app does not handle that primary event. See Primary and Secondary Input Events (above) for information on these secondary events.In this table, a game is an app that was submitted to the Amazon Appstore in the games category and installed onto the device from the Amazon Appstore.

For information on handling input from the Amazon Fire Game Controller, see Amazon Fire TV Game Controller Input.  Buttons  Capturing Input  Input Event ReferenceButtonsMost Amazon Fire TV remote controls have these buttons. Some Fire TV remotes do not include the microphone or voice search buttons.Remote controlCapturing InputAll Amazon Fire TV remote controls generate KeyEvent events for button presses, as any Android input device does. You can handle controller button input with standard Android event listener interfaces and callbacks (onClick(), onFocusChange(), and so on). Neither the Amazon Fire TV Remote nor the Voice Remote raises motion events (from the Android MotionEvent class).To capture specific button press events in your View, override input event handlers such as onKeyDown(). Test for the input constants from the KeyEvent class to capture specific keys.For example, to capture the LEFT, RIGHT, and CENTER D-Pad button (as well as the A button on a game controller), use this code:@Overridepublic boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event){boolean handled = false;switch (keyCode){case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER:case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BUTTON_A:        // ... handle selections        handled = true;        break;case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_LEFT:        // ... handle left action        handled = true;        break;case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_RIGHT:        // ... handle right action        handled = true;        break;}return handled || super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);}As with all input events, your listener method should return true to capture the event and handle it, or pass that event on to super.onKeyDown() so that other controls can manage it.Input Event ReferenceThe following table describes the buttons, the Android KeyEvent constants, and the default behavior of those buttons.

These controllers include the Amazon Fire TV Remote and Voice Remote, the Amazon Fire TV Game Controller, or any other controllers that support the Bluetooth gamepad HID profile.Use the motion and input events from the Remote Input and Game Controller Input to implement controller input for your app.This page provides recommendations for common app functionality across different controllers. None of these guidelines are requirements for publishing an app for Amazon Fire TV, and you may design controller input in the best way that works for your app. We suggest you follow these guidelines to enable a consistent user experience across different controllers, apps, and games. Note: With the exception of the Microphone button, the behavior of all Fire TV remote controls are identical.

Implement onPause() to preserve state in your app or game in case of an unanticipated Home. Implement onResume() to continue when the app resumes. Audio apps may continue playing in the background by requesting the audio focus.              Back      Back      Back      B      Return to the previous operation or screen (Activity), or cancel the current operation or prompt. Capture this event to provide confirmation dialogs. For example, on the main screen of your app, capture Back to provide a “Do you want to Quit” dialog.              Menu      Menu      Menu      Y      Invoke the standard Android context menu (OptionsMenu). Capture this event to provide your own menu, or for any other purpose. If your menu only has one option, you can use Menu as a toggle for that option. In media apps, use Menu to show or hide the playback chrome.              Search      Microphone (Voice Remote only)      N/A      N/A      This is a system event and cannot be captured in your app. When pressed, voice search is invoked. Implement onPause() to preserve state in your app or game when voice search launches, and onResume() to continue after it is complete. In audio apps, pause playback or lower the volume when voice search is active. In video apps, mute the audio or pause playback when voice search is active.              GameCircle      N/A      GameCircle      N/A      This is a system event and cannot be captured in your app. When pressed, the system displays the GameCircle overlay (for games with GameCircle support), a “Game Paused” dialog (for games without GameCircle support), or returns to the Games page in the launcher (for all other apps).  Note: Sideloaded apps always return to the Games page of the Launcher even if they implement GameCircle. Only apps that have been submitted to the Amazon Appstore demonstrate correct GameCircle behavior. You can use Live App Testing to test your GameCircle integration before you submit your app.  Implement  onPause() to preserve state in your app or game when the GameCircle button is pressed. Implement onResume() to continue when the user returns to your game.      Navigation and SelectionThe following table describes the recommended behavior for user interface navigation and selection. For items that show multiple buttons, provide support for both those buttons.

On the Amazon Fire Game Controller and other game controllers, the left stick should have the same behavior as the D-Pad.    Media PlaybackThe following table describes the recommended behavior for media playback. Note the following:  If your app does not play media or use the analog sticks or shoulder buttons (L1/R1), do not capture the events for those buttons. Doing so may interfere with the system’s ability to control media playing in the background.  If your app uses a framework such as Unity, you can ignore this recommendation, since the ability to pass key events through to the system is not supported in those frameworks.  If your app or game does use any of these buttons for other purposes, the user may access system media control from the GameCircle overlay (GameCircle button) or in the Fire TV launcher.

Volume ControlYou can stream audio to the headphone jack on the Amazon Fire TV Game Controller. Volume control for audio playback is available with the left and right trigger buttons (L2/R2). Volume control is a system function and cannot be mapped to other buttons in your app.Note the following:  If your app or game does not use these buttons, do not capture those input events. Doing so may interfere with the user’s ability to control the volume.  If your app or game does use those buttons for other purposes, the user may access system volume control from the GameCircle overlay or in the Fire TV launcher.

      "gamecontroller-api-html": {
        "title": "GameController API (Deprecated)",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Amazon Fire TV devices support up to seven Bluetooth controllers to be connected to the system at the same time, which enables you to develop multi-player apps and games. To identify controllers and manage input events, use standard Android mechanisms including the InputDevice class and Android event handlers onKeyUp(), onKeyDown() or onGenericMotionEvent()).In the past the Fire TV platform included a custom API to assist with input management of game controllers. As of Fire OS 5, the GameController API is deprecated and will be removed from the platform at a later date. If your app uses the GameController API we strongly suggest you move to using the standard Android (Lollipop, API 22) InputDevice APIs instead.This document describes how to migrate your code from the deprecated GameController API to standard Android input device APIs.  Controllers and Player Numbers  Migrating from the Amazon GameController API  Player Numbers in the GameController API (Deprecated)          Getting Player Numbers by Device ID      Getting Device IDs by Player Number      Getting the Number of Players      Getting GameController Objects by Player        Frame-Based Input Events in the GameController API (Deprecated)          Forwarding Events to GameController      Implementing the Game Loop                  Button Presses                      GameController API Event Constants (Deprecated)Controllers and Player NumbersThe GameController API is used primarily to associate player numbers with attached controllers. Much of this behavior is available in the standard Android InputDevice class through the getControllerNumber() method.Each controller is assigned a unique number when that controller is connected to Fire TV. The number may change if the controller is disconnected and connected again.Input devices such as remote controls that are not game controllers (specifically, that are not indicated by either InputDevice.SOURCE_GAMEPAD or InputDevice.SOURCE_JOYSTICK) have 0 as the controller number.Migrating from the Amazon GameController APIIn Fire OS 5, calls to the Fire TV GameController API still operate as they did previously. However, the GameController API is deprecated and will be removed from the platform at a later date. We strongly suggest that if your app currently uses the GameController API that you migrate your code to use standard Android input device management.To migrate your app from the GameController API:  Remove all references to the GameController class, including the com.amazon.device.gamecontroller package.  Remove GameController.init() from your onCreate() method.  Replace GameController methods for getting the player ID with Android InputDevice.getControllerNumber().  Replace the GameController event constants with standard Android KeyEvent or MotionEvent constants, as in the table below.

Note that controllers are assigned to player number slots and do not re-shuffle when an individual controller is disconnected, that is, player numbers are not consecutive.The GameController API includes methods to access the player numbers for available game controllers. If your game supports more than four players you can always manage controllers and player numbers inside your game on your own as well. Note: All of the methods in this section throw a NotInitializedException exception if you have not called GameController.init() before using them.Getting Player Numbers by Device IDUse the GameController.getPlayerNumber() static method with an Android device ID to get the player number for that device. You can get an Android device ID with the InputDevice.getDeviceIDs() method, from any key or motion event (InputEvent.getDeviceId()), or from a player number with GameController.getDeviceID().Player numbers are defined system-wide. Not all device IDs may be associated with a player number. If this is the case getPlayerNumber() throws the PlayerNumberNotFoundException exception.int[] ids = InputDevice.getDeviceIds();for (int i=0; i &lt; ids.length; i++) {    try {       int playerNum = GameController.getPlayerNumber(ids[i]);    }   catch (PlayerNumberNotFoundException e) {        // ...    }    // ...}Getting Device IDs by Player NumberThe GameController.getDeviceID() method is the reverse of getPlayerNumber(); given a player number (from 1 to 4), it returns the Android device ID. Not all player numbers may be associated with device IDs. If this is the case GameController.getDeviceID() throws the DeviceNotFoundException exception.for (int n = 0; n &lt; GameController.MAX_PLAYERS; n++) {    try {        int devicenum = GameController.getDeviceID(n + 1);    }    catch (DeviceNotFoundException e) {        // ...    }    // ...}Getting the Number of PlayersUse the GameController.getPlayerCount() static method to get the number of available players. Note that player numbers are not necessarily consecutive, for example, two players may be assigned to slots 2 and 4.int players = GameController.getPlayerCount();Getting GameController Objects by PlayerUse the GameController.getControllerByPlayer() static method with a player number to retrieve a GameController object for use with frame-based event input (see Frame-Based Input Events). Player numbers are assigned by the system and can be from 1 to 4. Not all player numbers may have associated controllers. If this is the case GameController.getControllerbyPlayer() throws the PlayerNumberNotFoundException exception.for (int n = 0; n &lt; GameController.MAX_PLAYERS; n++) {    GameController gameController = null;    try {        gameController =                GameController.getControllerByPlayer(n + 1);    }    catch (PlayerNumberNotFoundException e) {        // ...    }}Frame-Based Input Events in the GameController API (Deprecated)You can always handle input events from controller using the standard Android event-driven programming model, in which your code handles input events as they arrive. The GameController class enables you to use a frame-based input model, in which events are cached and you can query the state of the controller before rendering each frame. With this model, you use the following steps:  Provide your own game loop to replace the standard Android event model.  Forward standard input events to GameController.  For each frame within the loop:          Query the state of each controller for player input.      Render the frame using that input data.       Note: All of the methods in this section throw a NotInitializedException exception if you have not called GameController.init() before using them.Forwarding Events to GameControllerTo use the GameController API to manage your input events, forward key and motion events to the GameController class to handle. Override the onKeyUp(), onKeyDown() and onGenericMotionEvent() methods to pass those events to GameController://Forward key down events to GameController so it can manage state@Overridepublic boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {    boolean handled = false;    try {        handled = GameController.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);    }    catch (DeviceNotFoundException e) {    }    return handled || super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);}//Forward key up events to GameController so it can manage state@Overridepublic boolean onKeyUp(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {    boolean handled = false;    try {        handled = GameController.onKeyUp(keyCode, event);    }    catch (DeviceNotFoundException e) {    }    return handled || super.onKeyUp(keyCode, event);}//Forward motion events to GameController so it can manage state@Overridepublic boolean onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent event) {    boolean handled = false;    try {        handled = GameController.onGenericMotionEvent(event);    }    catch (DeviceNotFoundException e) {    }    return handled || super.onGenericMotionEvent(event);}Implementing the Game LoopImplement the game loop on your own thread. Inside the run() method for that thread, test for input and render each frame based on that input. Don’t forget to stop and start the thread in your activity’s onPause()) and onResume()) methods.Within the loop, use GameController.startFrame() to reset the input event queue between frames. Here’s a simple example:while (running){    GameController.startFrame();    //Draw the background    //Draw each player    for (int n = 0; n GameController.DEAD_ZONE * GameController.DEAD_ZONE){    //stick angle is greater than the center dead zone    x[n] += Math.round(deltaX * 10);    y[n] += Math.round(deltaY * 10);}Button PressesUse the wasButtonPressed() or wasButtonReleased() methods to test whether button input has occurred since the last frame:if (gameController.wasButtonPressed(GameController.BUTTON_A)    || gameController.wasButtonPressed(GameController.BUTTON_DPAD_CENTER)){    // draw a circle at the current player's x,y position}Use isButtonPressed() to test the current state of any button://Dpad button presses, move the player's position:x[n] += gameController.isButtonPressed(GameController.BUTTON_DPAD_RIGHT) ? +5 : 0;x[n] += gameController.isButtonPressed(GameController.BUTTON_DPAD_LEFT) ? -5 : 0;y[n] += gameController.isButtonPressed(GameController.BUTTON_DPAD_DOWN) ? +5 : 0;y[n] += gameController.isButtonPressed(GameController.BUTTON_DPAD_UP) ? -5 : 0;GameController API Event Constants (Deprecated)The GameController class includes a set of static event constants that represent button and axis event types. These constants are identical to the standard constants from the KeyEvent and MotionEvent classes, but are the same for any controller, and are often more logically named. For example, GameController.BUTTON_A is identical to KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BUTTON_A . Use these constants with the frame-based controller model described in Frame-Based Input Events. Note: For standard controller buttons (Back, Media Play/FF/Rewind), manage those events with standard Android KeyEvent and MotionEvent events. The Home and GameCircle buttons are system events and cannot be captured by your app.            Game Controller Control      Analog Movement: wasAxisChanged() getAxisValue()      Button Presses:  wasButtonPressed()  wasButtonReleased()  isButtonPressed()      Default Behavior (if the event is not handled by your code)                  D-Pad  (Left/Right)      AXIS_HAT_X  (&gt;0 is right)      none      Move the focus in the user interface in the given direction.

        "content": "The Amazon Fire TV platform enables users to connect up to seven Bluetooth controllers at the same time. If your app or game supports input from multiple users or players, you need to be able to determine the connected controllers, identify the features of those controllers, and differentiate user input coming from different controllers.The Fire TV platform uses standard Android features of the InputDevice class. The InputDevice class enables you to get a list of all the connected input devices (including controllers) and query the features of an input device.You can also get an input device object from any key or motion event, which enables you to handle input from different controllers or different users as it occurs.  Getting Input Devices and Device IDs          Get All Input Device IDs      Get the Input Device ID from a Key or Motion Event        Identifying Controller Features          Is this Device a Game Controller?      Is this Device a Remote?      Is this Device a Second Screen App?      Getting Input Devices and Device IDsInput devices connected to Amazon Fire TV are represented by the Android InputDevice class. Connected input devices are given a device ID at system boot and when a new device is added.  Input devices in the list of IDs can be actual controllers such as game controllers, or they can represent other forms of input such as the onscreen keyboard. The device IDs themselves are arbitrary and do not uniquely identify a specific controller or controller type.You can get the list of all the available device IDs to determine the number and type of controllers available to your app or game. You can also get device IDs or input device objects from a specific key or motion event, to determine which controller was being used for that event.Get All Input Device IDsYou can get an array of all the available input devices IDs with the static InputDevice.getDeviceIds() method, and then associate those IDs with actual input device objects with InputDevice.getDevice():int[] ids = InputDevice.getDeviceIds();for (int i=0;i &lt; ids.length; i++) {// get an InputDevice object based on the device IDInputDevice device = InputDevice.getDevice(ids[i]);// ...}Note that the list of device IDs you get from the getDeviceIds() method contains only those input devices that are actually connected to the system.  Some Bluetooth controllers may disconnect (sleep) to save power if they have not been used in some time, or a controller may disconnect if it is out of range.Sleeping or otherwise unavailable controllers are not considered connected and are not enumerated in the list of device IDs.  You can listen for controller connect and disconnect events by implementing the InputDeviceListener interface.Get the Input Device ID from a Key or Motion EventYou can get the ID of the device that triggered a key or motion event inside an event handler with the InputEvent.getDeviceId() method:public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {int id = event.getDeviceId();InputDevice device = InputDevice.getDevice(id);}Or, just get the input device object itself:public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {InputDevice device = event.getDevice();}Identifying Controller FeaturesAndroid input device IDs are arbitrary and do not uniquely identify any controller or controller type.  To determine the type of input device, query the features of that device to determine whether input came from a controller (a remote, game controller, or second screen app), or from some other device.Use the InputDevice.getSources() method to get the features of an input device.  This method returns an integer bitmap that indicates device capabilities and features.  Use the constants defined the InputDevice class to compare that bitmap with the specific features your app is interested in.// get an InputDevice object based on the device IDInputDevice device = InputDevice.getDevice(id);// getSources() gives you an integer bitmap that defines the features of the device;// compare with constants from InputDevice to find controller featuresif ((device.getSources() &amp; InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_JOYSTICK != 0 {// this controller has a joystick}You can also get input device feature bitmaps directly from key and motion events with the InputEvent.getSource() method:public boolean onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent event) {// did this event come from a joystick?if ((event.getSource() &amp; InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_JOYSTICK) != 0) {// ... handle input events from controllers with joysticks }// ...}Is this Device a Game Controller?You can identify game controllers (both the Amazon game controller and other game controllers) by testing for both the InputDevice.SOURCE_GAMEPAD and InputDevice.SOURCE_JOYSTICK constants.  Note that this code does not differentiate between an Amazon game controller and a Bluetooth controller from another manufacturer.int hasFlags = InputDevice.SOURCE_GAMEPAD | InputDevice.SOURCE_JOYSTICK;boolean isGamepad = inputDevice.getSources() &amp; hasFlags == hasFlags;Is this Device a Remote?You can identify the Amazon Fire TV Remote or Voice Remote by the InputDevice.SOURCE_DPAD constant.  However, as some keyboards may also identify themselves as having a D-Pad, you should also test for the keyboard type (InputDevice.KEYBOARD_TYPE_NON_ALPHABETIC):int hasFlags =  InputDevice.SOURCE_DPAD;bool isRemote = (inputDevice.getSources() &amp; hasFlags == hasFlags)&amp;&amp; inputDevice.getKeyboardType() == InputDevice.KEYBOARD_TYPE_NON_ALPHABETIC;Is this Device a Second Screen App?You can identify the Amazon Second Screen app with both the InputDevice.SOURCE_MOUSE and InputDevice.SOURCE_TOUCHPAD constants.int hasFlags =  InputDevice.SOURCE_MOUSE | InputDevice.SOURCE_TOUCHPAD;bool isRemote = inputDevice.getSources() &amp; hasFlags == hasFlags;",

Fire TV (2nd Generation): Refers to the second version of the Fire TV box (released in 2015).  Fire TV Stick: Refers to the first (and so far only) version of the Fire TV stick (released in 2014). Note: Usually the latest version of the Fire TV box is just referred to as “Fire TV,” but since this documentation contrasts two versions of Fire TV, the terms “Fire TV – 1st Generation” and “Fire TV – 2nd Generation” are used. These terms always refer to the box. There is just one version of Fire TV Stick, so there’s no need to distinguish versions through a 1st Generation or 2nd Generation descriptor.Four Ways to Play Dolby AudioYou can play Dolby (DD or DDP) audio content in your app in four ways:  Custom Media Player Approach  ExoPlayer  Other Supported Media Players  Android Media PlayerOption 1: Custom Media Player ApproachImplement a custom player that uses  AudioManager,  AudioTrack, and (optionally)  MediaCodec APIs. This section specifies the use of AudioManager, AudioTrack, and optionally MediaCodec APIs to play Dolby audio content as recommended by Android.AudioManager OverviewAndroid L enhanced the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent in AudioManager to report the capabilities of sinks in Lollipop. This intent is broadcast whenever HDMI is plugged into or unplugged from to the device.This intent also has a provision for apps to detect the capabilities of the connected endpoint (AVR or TV) via EXTRA_ENCODINGS present in the intent. The possible values are one of the ENCODING_XXXX values. For example:  ENCODING_PCM_16BIT  ENCODING_AC3  ENCODING_E_AC3, and so onAudioTrack OverviewAndroid L added the support of ENCODING_AC3 and ENCODING_E_AC3 encoding formats to AudioFormat. If the AudioTrack is configured with Dolby encoding format, and if the connecting endpoint supports that encoding format, AudioTrack accepts the Dolby raw bitstream as input and passes the bitstream to the endpoint after IEC61937 packetization. AudioTrack supports only clear (not encrypted) input bitstream.Additionally, the creation of AudioTrack fails if the encoding format is not supported by the connected endpoint.Applications can use the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent to find the list of supported Dolby encoding formats for the connected device, create AudioTrack with one of the supported Dolby encoding formats, and pass the corresponding Dolby raw bitstream (in clear) as input to AudioTrack to achieve Dolby pass-through playback.Optionally, AudioTrack can also support transcoding DDP bitstream to DD if the connected endpoint only supports DD. This feature is made available to the application by adding ENCODING_E_AC3 to the EXTRA_ENCODINGS extra of the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent if the endpoint only supports DD.Hence, from an application’s perspective, an endpoint that supports DD also supports DDP and can continue to send DDP bitstream to AudioTrack, which internally transcodes the bitstream to DD before passing it through.MediaCodec (Optional) Overview Tip: Apps that use MediaCodec for Dolby must also be able to operate on devices without Dolby availability in MediaCodec. To do so, call findDecoderForFormat. If Dolby is not supported, apps must fall back to non-Dolby (such as AAC) content.AudioTrack does not support Dolby audio content that is encrypted with DRM keys. Hence, for an encrypted Dolby audio bitstream, it is mandatory to use MediaCodec APIs to decrypt the bitstream and then pass the decrypted bitstream to AudioTrack.Android provides a generic raw audio decoder via MediaCodec interface named “OMX.google.raw.dec,” which is essentially a no-op (no operation) copy decoder. If the bitstream is encrypted, it uses MediaCrypto APIs to decrypt the bitstream and outputs it. Apps must use this decoder to decrypt the encrypted Dolby bitstream and pass the clear Dolby bitstream to AudioTrack.Optionally, a platform can support Dolby decoder via MediaCodec interface. This decoder decodes the Dolby audio bitstream to PCM. Applications can use findDecoderForFormat to detect the presence of a decoder that supports Dolby MIME type.The following table summarizes various Dolby playback scenarios in a typical Android TV that does not support DDP to DD transcode in AudioTrack.

This section describes the Dolby support in Fire TV (2nd Generation).AudioTrack (Fire TV – 2nd Generation)AudioTrack supports both DDP/DD pass-through and DDP-to-DD transcoder. The AudioTrack accepts Dolby raw bitstream and, depending on the Dolby capability of the endpoint, decides to either do a DD/DDP pass-through or DDP-to-DD transcode and pass-through.AudioManager (Fire TV – 2nd Generation)Since AudioTrack also supports transcoding DDP bitstream to DD when the connected endpoint only supports DD, AudioManager indicates this by adding ENCODING_E_AC3 to the EXTRA_ENCODINGS extra of the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent if the endpoint only supports DD.Hence, from an application’s perspective, an endpoint that supports DD also supports DDP and can continue to send DDP bitstream to AudioTrack, which internally transcodes it to DD before passing it through.MediaCodec (Fire TV – 2nd Generation)The MediaCodec for Dolby Decoder (OMX.dolby.ac3.decoder &amp; OMX.dolby.eac3.decoder) supports decoding to PCM only. Additionally, Dolby decoders also down-mixes the multi-channel output to stereo. So irrespective of the number of input channels of the content, the output is always stereo PCM.

Android L officially introduced support for Dolby pass-through audio in Android TV.Android L has a recommended architecture for Dolby integration in the platform, which unfortunately does not match with the Dolby integration architecture on Fire TV Stick. This section describes the Dolby support in Fire TV Stick. Note: The information contained in this section is applicable even though Fire TV Stick is now upgraded to Android L based Fire OS 5.MediaCodec (Fire TV Stick)The MediaCodec that handles Dolby bitstream supports all scenarios: Dolby pass-through, transcode, and decode. The MediaCodec depends on the Dolby capability of the connected endpoint and the system’s Dolby settings to select the appropriate mode for handling the incoming Dolby bitstream.  For Dolby pass-through or transcode mode, the decoder converts the raw input Dolby bitstream to the IEC61937 packetized format.  For Dolby decode mode, Dolby decoders also down-mixes the multi-channel output to stereo PCM. So irrespective of the number of input channels of the content, the output is always stereo PCM. The decoders available are OMX.dolby.ec3.decoder to handle DDP bitstream and OMX.dolby.ac3.decoder to handle DD bitstream.The following table illustrates the functionality of MediaCodec.

This is a subtle difference between Fire TV Stick and Fire TV.AudioTrack (Fire TV Stick)AudioTrack in Fire TV Stick has certain limitations — it does not support Dolby Transcode or Dolby Decode, and only supports Dolby Pass-through. Additionally,the input Dolby bitstream must be in IEC61937 packetized format — which is same as the output of Dolby MediaCodec decoders.Due to these architectural differences between Fire TV Stick and Android L, app developers need to do major changes in their app to support Dolby audio content playback. The application must always use MediaCodec (even if the content is not encrypted) to process the Dolby bitstream and must configure the AudioTrack based on the output MIME type indicated by MediaCodec. The following steps provide more detail about this process.A. Create the Decoder by MimeTypeCreate the MediaCodec by MIME Type (audio/eac3, audio/ec3, or audio/ac3). This is a generic Android way of creating a codec — no custom changes are required.B. Handle MediaCodec Output Format Change NotificationWhen the app starts using MediaCodec to process the input bit stream, it detects an output format change and returns INFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT_CHANGED in the dequeueOutputBuffer API call. The application must handle this response and use the getOutputFormat API to find out the output format MIME type. It should use this MIME type to configure AudioTrack as per the following table:            MimeType AudioFormat value                         audio/eac3      ENCODING_E_AC3              audio/ac3      ENCODING_AC3              audio/raw      ENCODING_PCM_16BIT      C. Limitations of AudioTrack for Dolby encoding formatsAudioTrack for Dolby encoding formats ENCODING_E_AC3 and ENCODING_AC3 has following limitations and known issues:  The AudioTrack start/pause API is not effective. Your app might start writing data to the AudioTrack just after creation, and as a result, it will start playing. It does not wait for start API to be called.  AudioTrack’s getTimeStamp API (which was introduced in KitKat) is back-ported to Jelly-Bean-based Fire TV – 1st Generation and Fire TV Stick and can be used for A/V Sync logic. Note: These limitations are applicable only for the Dolby audio formats mentioned in this section.Dolby Support in Fire TV — 1st GenerationFire TV – 1st Generation was initially built on a Jelly-Bean-based OS and launched much before Android L – which officially introduced support for Dolby audio pass-through in Android TV.Android L has a recommended architecture for Dolby integration in the platform, which unfortunately does not fully match with the Dolby integration architecture on Fire TV – 1st Generation). This section describes the Dolby architecture in Fire TV – 1st Generation. Note: The information contained in this section is applicable even though the Fire TV – 1st Generation is now upgraded with Android-L-based Fire OS 5.MediaCodec (Fire TV — 1st Generation)The default MediaCodec for Dolby MIME type available in Fire TV – 1st Generation is a pass-through decoder only. It copies input data to output data without changing the MIME type. Hence, the output format has same MIME type as that of the input format.The decoders available are OMX.qcom.audio.decoder.passthrougheac3 to handle DDP bitstream and OMX.qcom.audio.decoder.passthroughac3 to handle DD bitstream. In addition, these decoders also decrypt the data if it is encrypted by a DRM scheme. Hence, if the content is encrypted by DRM, applications must use this decoder. Otherwise, the usage of this decoder is optional and the Dolby bitstream can be passed to AudioTrack directly.AudioTrack (Fire TV — 1st Generation)AudioTrack handles Dolby pass-through, Dolby Decode, and Dolby transcode internally. This means that depending on the Dolby capability of the connected endpoint and the system Dolby setting, AudioTrack selects the appropriate mode of handling the incoming Dolby bitstream.endpoint capabilityInput stream typeDolby SettingHDMI OutputComments      DDP, DD, and PCM    DDP    DDP over HDMI/Optical or DDP Auto    DDP    DDP Passthrough        DDP OFF    PCM    DDP Decode        DD    DDP over HDMI/Optical, DD over HDMI, or DDP Auto    DD    DD Passthrough        DD and PCM    DDP    DDP over HDMI/Optical, DD over HDMI, or DDP Auto    DD    DDP &gt; DD Transcode        DDP OFF    PCM    DDP Decode        DD    DDP over HDMI/Optical, DD over HDMI, or DDP Auto    DD    DD Passthrough        DDP OFF    PCM    DD Decode        PCM    DDP or DD    NA    PCM    DD or DDP decode  Limitations of AudioTrack for Dolby Encoding Formats (Fire TV — 1st Generation)AudioTrack for Dolby encoding formats ENCODING_E_AC3 and ENCODING_AC3 has following limitations and known issues:  The getPlaybackHeadPosition API of AudioTrack is not implemented. Consequently, do not depend on it for A/V sync. Your app must not call this API. Calling this API may result into a crash.  AudioTrack’s start/pause API is not effective. You app might start writing data to the AudioTrack just after creation and it will start playing. It does not wait for start API to be called.  AudioTrack’s getTimeStamp API (which was introduced in KitKat) is back-ported to Jelly-Bean-based Fire TV 1st Gen and Fire TV Stick and can be used for A/V Sync logic via reflection. Note: These limitations are applicable only for the Dolby audio formats mentioned in this section.Option 2: Use ExoPlayerExoPlayer is a open source player backed by Google that supports playing Dolby audio stream. However, due to the architectural differences in Dolby support between a standard Android L device and Fire TV – 1st Generation family of devices (as described in preceding sections), ExoPlayer fails to play Dolby audio content.Amazon has developed patches for Exoplayer to enable playback of Dolby audio content in Fire TV Gen1 family of devices. These patches are open sourced here: exoplayer-amazon-port. This port also includes other patches required to enable playback of PlayReady DRM protected content. (Note that each “amazon/rx.y.z” branch maps to ExoPlayer version x.y.z.)Option 3: Use Other Supported Media PlayersYou can use other supported media players for Fire TV, such as VisualOn or NexPlayer, to play Dolby audio content and DRM content. Refer to Media Players for Fire TV for further details.Option 4: Use Android Media PlayerYour app can use Android MediaPlayer to play Dolby content.Handling non-Dolby End-Points and Private Listening ModesThis section describes recommendations and best practices for Dolby audio content playback on the Fire TV family of devices when connected to a non-Dolby endpoint and private listening. Following these guidelines will help you create the best user experience for Dolby audio content playback.As described previously, Android L introduced a new API in AudioManager called ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent. This intent allows apps to detect the capabilities of the connected endpoint (AVR or TV). This detection can be used to support Dolby audio content playback in various scenarios including private listening.  Q. How does an app detect the capabilities of the connected endpoint?  The app must register a broadcast receiver to receive the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent and read the EXTRA_ENCODINGS extra values in the intent. This list of encoding values will indicate the endpoint capabilities. The possible values are one of the ENCODING_XXXX values (for example, ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, ENCODING_AC3, ENCODING_E_AC3, and so on).  Q. Which audio stream should be selected for playback when the connected endpoint does not support DD or DDP?  In these cases, let your app select a non-Dolby audio content for playback (for example, AAC). This option has the advantage of reduced bandwidth usage as compared to Dolby audio content.    However, if the app cannot select an alternative non-Dolby audio content and chooses to continue to stream Dolby (DD or DDP) audio, it must do the following for each device.          Fire TV – 1st Generation: Send Dolby raw bitstream to AudioTrack, which internally decodes and down-mixes to stereo PCM.      Fire TV Stick and Fire TV – 2nd Generation: Use the MediaCodec for Dolby (OMX.dolby.ac3.decoder or OMX.dolby.eac3.decoder). This MediaCodec decodes the Dolby bitstream, down-mixes to stereo PCM, and configures AudioTrack with the ENCODING_PCM_16BIT audio format to render the PCM data. Since the Dolby Decoder in all the platforms down-mixes multi-channel content to stereo, there is no real advantage in choosing Dolby audio content when the endpoint does not support DD or DDP.         Tip: It is strongly recommended that you select a non-Dolby audio stream when the device is connected to an endpoint that does not support Dolby (DD or DDP).    Q. Which audio stream should be selected for playback when the connected endpoint supports DD but does not support DDP?  The answer depends on the Fire TV device:          Fire TV – 1st Generation and Fire TV – 2nd Generation: AudioTrack supports transcoding DDP bitstream to DD. Hence, even if the endpoint supports DD only, AudioManager appends DDP as the supported capability in the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent. As a result, from an app’s perspective, the endpoint that supports DD also supports DDP (via transcoding in AudioTrack).      Fire TV Stick: The app can select any audio content for playback because the MediaCodec decides whether to pass-through, transcode, or decode based on endpoint capabilities. In this use case, it would pass-through DD or transcode DDP to DD and pass-through DD.        Q. Which audio stream should be selected for playback when the connected endpoint supports DDP and DD?  Fire TV – 1st Generation and Fire TV – 2nd Generation: The app can select DDP or DD audio content for playback. If the audio is not encrypted, the app can then send this clear DD/DDP bitstream data as is to AudioTrack. Internally, AudioTrack will pass-through the DD/DDP bitstream to the connected endpoint.    If the audio contend is DRM protected, the app must instantiate the following MediaCodec to decrypt the bitstream:                  In Fire TV – 1st Generation, OMX.qcom.audio.decoder.passthrougheac3 or OMX.qcom.audio.decoder.passthroughac3 . This special decoder is a no-op pass-through decoder that supports decryption (that is, it copies the input bitstream to output after decrypting if needed).                    In Fire TV – 2nd Generation, OMX.google.raw.dec (by name). This special decoder is a no-op pass-through decoder that supports decryption (that is, it copies the input bitstream to output after decrypting if needed).               Note: OMX.google.raw.dec is also available in the Fire OS 5 version of Fire TV – 1st Generation.    Fire TV Stick: The app can select any audio content for playback because the MediaCodec decides whether to pass-through, transcode, or decode based on the endpoint capabilities. In this use case it would pass-through the Dolby audio content.    Q. How does the app handle private listening use cases involving audio headsets or Bluetooth A2DP headsets during Dolby pass-through playback?  Fire TV – 1st Generation: The app does not need to do anything special to handle the private listening use cases. This is automatically taken care of internally in AudioTrack (it switches over from pass-through to decode the mode of operating).    Fire TV Stick and Fire TV – 2nd Generation: When either an audio headset (via a game controller) or Bluetooth headset is connected to the device during Dolby pass-through playback, the operating system re-broadcasts the ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent with modified encoding extra values.    Since the audio headset via a game controller or Bluetooth headset do not support Dolby pass-through, the encoding extra value would now be ENCODING_PCM_16BIT only. The app must register to receive this intent during playback and re-configure the audio pipeline to do one of the following:          Switch to an alternate non-Dolby audio content mid-stream (for example AAC)      If an alternative audio content is not available, re-configure the audio pipeline to use the MediaCodec Dolby decoder to decode the Dolby content to Stereo PCM. In case of Fire TV Stick, re-creation of the MediaCodec is required as part of re-creating the audio pipeline.         Note: The first option (switching to non-Dolby audio) is highly recommended because the Dolby decoder in the device always down-mixes multi-channel output to stereo internally, regardless of the endpoint’s multi-channel capabilities. As a result, there is no advantage of playing the 5.1 Dolby stream over stereo with a non-Dolby stream. Additionally, the non-Dolby audio stream (such as AAC) consumes less bandwidth than the multi-channel Dolby audio stream.  ",

Hence, in order to play 4K UHD content, you must switch the TV to 4K UHD display mode. This switching between HDMI display modes is referred to as an HDMI Mode switch. The HDMI Mode switch is triggered by the application when it needs to play 4K UHD content.Amazon developed an Amazon Extension Library for 4K that provides high level APIs to trigger this HDMI Mode switch and show a user-friendly overlay message before the TV starts switching the display mode. This overlay message improves the overall customer experience. Note: Fire TV (2nd Generation) supports only up to 30 FPS for 4K UHD content.Certification and Performance TestingApps that support Ultra HD video will be certified by Amazon to ensure they meet the required customer experience. Typically, certification takes a couple of weeks.When you submit your app, add a note that it is 4K-enabled. Most likely in your app’s description, you would already highlight to users that your app offers 4K Ultra HD media playback. But adding a manual note will also let Amazon know to apply 4K performance testing on the app during the certification process.4K Ultra HD SpecificationsResolution and Refresh RateAmazon Fire TV (2nd Generation) supports the following output resolutions:  4K UHD at 24 FPS  4K UHD at 25 FPS  4K UHD at 30 FPS  Full HD (1080p) up to 60 FPSAmazon Fire TV (2nd Generation) is expected to stay mostly in Full HD (1080p) mode at 60 FPS, even on TVs that support 4K UHD format. Fire TV (2nd Generation) switches to 4K UHD mode only for 4K UHD content playback.The following frame rates are recommended when playing content:  For Full HD (1080p) and HD (720p) content, leave the device in Full HD (1080p) 60 FPS mode and use frame rate conversion from the content’s native frame rate (as in Fire TV - 1st Generation).  For 4K UHD content, switch to the nearest 4K UHD mode before starting playback. For example, switch to 4K UHD at 24 FPS to play 4k UHD content of 24 FPS or 23.97 FPS, switch to 4K UHD at 25 FPS to play content of 25 FPS, and switch to 4K UHD at 30 FPS to play content of 30 FPS or 29.97 FPS.  Initiate a mode switch only if the user enters the playback window or if the next title in the queue requires a different playback resolution / frame rate. Note: Fire TV (2nd Generation) switches the display back to Full HD at 60 FPS whenever the activity that switched the display to 4K mode is paused. An activity can be paused in several ways, such as pressing “BACK” button, the “HOME” button, or programmatically launching another activity on top of it.DRM SystemsAmazon Fire TV (2nd Generation) supports the following DRM solutions:  Widevine L1/L3 DRM  PlayReady DRM (2.5 max)  HDCP 2.2 link to compatible panelsCodecsAmazon Fire TV (2nd Generation) supports the following codecs:  MediaCodec that supports HEVC main L5 profile  MediaCodec that supports HEVC main10 L5 profile (The output will be in 8-bit Rec 709 color space for both 8-bit and 10-bit color input.)Input/Output Color FormatsAmazon Fire TV (2nd Generation) supports the following color specs:                              Supported Input Color Formats      Output Color Formats                  8-bit Rec709 (HEVC Main profile L5)      8-bit Rec709              10-bit Rec709 (HEVC Main10 profile L5)      8-bit Rec709              10-bit Rec2020 (HEVC Main10 profile L5)      8-bit Rec709      10-bit color input is supported by the codec, but the output does not support 10-bit output.Power ConsumptionThe following table specifies the maximum allowed power consumption for Fire TV devices:                                          Fire TV Stick (Gen. 2)      Fire TV (Gen. 2)      Fire TV Stick (Gen. 1)      Fire TV (Gen. 1)                  2.1 W      3.8 Watts      1.7 Watts      3.6 Watts      Run the app 10 minutes before measuring the power consumption on the Fire TV Stick. For Fire TV, run the app for at least 30 minutes before taking the power measurement. Your power measurement can continue for 5 minutes.If the power consumption from your app exceeds the limits in the previous table, Fire TV will throttle the performance of your app. If throttling is not enough, Fire TV will reset the system.In your code, you can check for the device (whether Fire TV Stick or Fire TV) by looking for the amazon.hardware.low_power feature. See Identifying Amazon Fire TV Devices for more details.APIs for HDMI Mode SwitchGoogle introduced 4K Display.Mode APIs in Android Marshmallow. Display.Mode allows applications to query physical display sizes and switch to a different HDMI display mode.Amazon implemented Display.Mode APIs in Fire TV (2nd Generation) running Fire OS 5 (based on Android L). Apps can use these APIs for the HDMI Mode switch.Since these APIs are not part of Android API Level 21 (Lollipop) in Android SDK, the apps can use “reflection” to access the APIs.  Alternatively, app developers can use the 4K Extension Library developed by Amazon, which wraps these Android APIs via reflection and provides a simple interface for them.You can also display an optional interstitial developed by Amazon to prepare customers for the HDMI Mode switch. This interstitial is distributed as part of the Amazon Extension Library For 4K.Fire OS will also provide a sys.display-size system property to report the maximum supported resolution of the connected display.Steps for Using HDMI Mode SwitchFollow these general steps when using the Android API to initiate an HDMI Mode switch:      Query supported display modes with Display.getSupportedModes().    Display.getSupportedModes() returns an array of Display.Mode objects. This synchronous API returns the modes (resolution and frame rate) supported by both Fire TV (2nd Generation) and the attached display. If the attached display supports 4K UHD, then 4K UHD modes will be included in the list.    Because frame rate conversion may not provide optimal results, Amazon recommends switching to the actual or closest frame rate of the content to be played (4K at 24fps, 4K at 25fps, or 4K at 30fps).        Retrieve the current display resolution and frame rate using Display.getMode().    Display.getMode() returns the current display resolution and refresh rate in a Display.Mode object.        Set the Display mode with the WindowManager.LayoutParams.preferredDisplayModeId property.    Applications use WindowManager.LayoutParams.preferredDisplayModeId property to initiate a mode switch. This allows the application to start up in Full HD (1080p) and then initiate a mode switch to 4K UHD when the user starts playback of 4K UHD content. Note the following:          A mode switch will not be initiated during Activity transitions if both activities prefer the same mode.      System and voice overlays will not initiate a mode switch.      The display switches back to Full HD (1080p) resolution when either the application or activity terminates.      The Display.Mode class definition aligns with Android Marshmallow.            Get notification for when the mode switch negotiation is complete.    Through the onDisplayChanged(int displayId) method, you can be notified when the mode switch negotiation is complete.    DisplayManager.DisplayListener sends a callback when properties of logical display have changed. This callback will be received once the mode change is complete. Note that the displayed content may not be visible for a few seconds after the callback is received.  Interface for developersApplications can use these APIs directly via reflection, or they can use an Amazon provided wrapper (the 4K Extension Library) to access these APIs. The following code sample shows the mode change directly without the extension:WindowManager.LayoutParams mWindowAttributes = mTargetWindow.getAttributes();try { if (attributeFlagField == null) {  Class &lt; ? &gt; cLayoutParams = mWindowAttributes.getClass();  attributeFlagField = cLayoutParams.getDeclaredField(sPreferredDisplayModeIdFieldName); } //attempt mode switch attributeFlagField.setInt(mWindowAttributes, modeId); mTargetWindow.setAttributes(mWindowAttributes);} catch (Exception e) { Log.e(TAG, e.getLocalizedMessage());}The approach using the 4K Extension Library is covered in the next section.Amazon 4K Extension LibraryHDMI Mode Switch APIs in Fire TV (2nd Generation) are not available in Android Lollipop SDK. To use them, you must use reflection. Amazon built the 4K Extension Library (provided in the form of source code) to demonstrate how to use the Android APIs and provide a helper class. Download Amazon 4K ExtensionThe extension ZIP file includes a sample app inside the Test folder called “DisplayModeCheckSample.” There’s also a Javadoc file, which you can view by expanding the doc &gt; javadoc folder and opening the index.html file.To build the app, go to File &gt; Open in Android Studio and select the DisplayModeCheckSample project. Then click the Run ‘app’ button . When you build the app, you will see a screen such as this:When you switch modes, the interstitial appears (on an Ultra HD TV) and the app switches to 4K Ultra HD mode.Amazon’s 4K Extension Library contains the classes listed in the following sections. In addition, it includes the API for displaying the “Amazon Interstitial” to prepare customers for the HDMI Mode switch on Amazon 4K devices. The following sections describe these classes.UHDHelper classUHDHelpder is a convenience class that wraps the 4K UHD capabilities and Mode Switch APIs. It provides the following public methods:setPreferredDisplayModeId(Window targetWindow, int modeId, boolean allowOverlayDisplay)This method lets you request a specific display mode (resolution and refresh rate). This method initiates a mode switch on the supported devices if the display is not currently set at the requested mode. UhdHelperListener is used to notify the application that the mode switch HDMI negotiation is complete.            Parameters      Description                  targetWindow      Window to use for setting the display and call parameters.              modeId      The desired mode to switch to. Must be a valid mode supported by the platform.              allowOverlayDisplay      Flag request to allow display overlay on applicable device.      Note that mode switch requests might not be successful, and you must verify the mode from UHDHelperListener#onModeChanged(Display.Mode mode) or call getMode(). You must wait until the mode switch is complete before starting content playback. Also, the mode switch works only with Fire TV (2nd Generation).”getSupportedModes()Determines all the supported modes on the connected device.            Returns                  An array of Mode objects or NULL if an error occurred.      getMode()Returns the current mode that the display is set to. This method is also used to determine the success of a mode switch. When a mode switch is in progress, the result of getMode() is undefined.            Returns                  Mode that is currently set on the system or NULL if an error occurred.      UhdHelperListener classThe UhdHelperListener class provides the onModeChanged(Display.Mode mode) method. This method is used to inform applications when the mode switch HDMI negotiation is complete. It also provides the current mode (which could be the requested mode) if the mode change was successful.            Parameters      Description                  mode      The Mode object containing the mode switched to, or NULL if there was a timeout or internal error while changing the mode.      Display.Mode classThe Display.Mode class mirrors the Display.Mode class in Android Marshmallow. This is used to describe a display mode’s resolution and refresh rate.Interstitial during Mode SwitchBecause the customer experience is interrupted during an HDMI Mode switch, Amazon has built an interstitial that can be optionallydisplayed to prepare customers before the HDMI Mode switch. The code to trigger this interstitial is available with the Amazon Extension Library For 4K.To display the interstitial through the extension code, call setPreferredDisplayModeId(Window_targetWindow, int_modeId boolean_allowOverlayDisplay) with allowOverlayDisplay set to true. The overlay will be shown for two seconds prior to the start of the mode switch.",

        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The Advertising ID is a user-resettable, unique, anonymous identifier that can be used for advertising and user analytics. Users can reset the Advertising ID or opt out of tracking for interest-based ads altogether. The Advertising ID is currently available for tablet devices running Fire OS 5.1 and later and TV devices running Fire OS 5.2.1.1 and later.On Fire TV, users can manage the Advertising ID by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; Advertising ID.  When to Use the Advertising ID  Developer Expectations  Verifying and Responding to the User’s Advertising ID ChoicesWhen to Use the Advertising IDYou should use the Advertising ID (when supported by the device) if your app does the following:  Displays ads  Collects data for user analytics  Collects data to build user profiles for advertising purposes or for targeting users with interest based advertisingWhen available, use the Advertising ID over any other ID. Ensure that if you use a third-party ad service in your app, the service follows the requirements around the user’s choice.Developer ExpectationsWhen you use the Advertising ID, follow these principles:  Use the Advertising ID only for advertising and user analytics.  When the user opts out of interest-based ads, the Advertising ID is still available but the developer must honor the user’s opt-out choice. Do not collect information about the user’s behavior to build user profiles for advertising purposes or show them interest based ads. In your code, precede any call to retrieve the Advertising ID with a call that verifies the user’s opt-out choice. Allowed activities include contextual advertising, frequency capping, conversion tracking, reporting, and security and fraud detection.  Do not associate any persistent device identifier or personally-identifiable information with the Advertising ID unless the user has explicitly given consent to do so.  When a user resets the Advertising ID, do not fold earlier data into the new Advertising ID or associate the new ID with the old one unless the user has explicitly given consent for you to do so.For more information, see the App Distribution and Services Agreement.Verifying and Responding to the User’s Advertising ID ChoicesThe Android Settings.Secure class exposes the user’s Advertising ID choices through the getInt and getString methods. The following Java example shows the logic for verifying the user setting and retrieving an Advertising ID (if available).import android.content.ContentResolver;import android.provider.Settings.Secure;import android.provider.Settings.SettingNotFoundException;String advertisingID = \"\";boolean limitAdTracking = false;try {    ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();    // get user's tracking preference    limitAdTracking = (Secure.getInt(cr, \"limit\\_ad\\_tracking\") == 0) ? false : true;    // get advertising    advertisingID = Secure.getString(cr, \"advertising\\_id\");} catch (SettingNotFoundException ex) {    // not supported}The code first gets the user’s ad tracking preference. Then depending on the ad tracking value, the following happens:  If the user has allowed ad tracking, the value for limit_ad_tracking will be false.  If the user has disabled ad tracking, the value for limit_ad_tracking will be 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. (Note: This is a bug. In the future, the value will be true, similar to the response for Fire tablets. )   The Advertising ID gets stored in the advertisingID variable. A sample Advertising ID value might be df07c7dc-cea7-4a89-b328-810ff5acb15d. (For child profiles, the advertisingID will be 00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000.)  If the system doesn’t return any value for limit_ad_tracking (such as for non-Fire-OS devices or Fire Devices running older versions of FireOS), a SettingNotFoundException gets thrown. You can handle this exception as desired.  When a user toggles the interest based opt-out value (from enabled to disabled or vice-versa), the Advertising ID is set to a new value. (Note: This is a bug. In the future, the same Advertising ID will be retained, similar to how it works on Fire tablets.)",

HDMI Disconnection  Letting the App Know about HDMI Events  Other Connection EventsHDMI DisconnectionThe recommended behavior of an HDMI disconnection — because the TV is powered OFF, input to the TV switched to another HDMI port, or the HDMI cable disconnected physically — is as follows:  Apps that play video must pause playback when the TV is turned off or HDMI cable is disconnected. When the TV is powered ON or HDMI cable connected, playback should remain paused until the user explicitly presses PLAY button on the remote.  Apps that play only audio may continue to play even if the HDMI is disconnected, provided the Fire TV is connected to another audio device via digital optical cable (Fire TV – 1st Generation only), Bluetooth A2DP headset, or audio headset via the Game controller.Letting the App Know about HDMI EventsTo let your app know about connection or disconnection, listen for ACTION_HDMI_AUDIO_PLUG intent broadcast that has an extra (EXTRA_AUDIO_PLUG_STATE) indicating if the HDMI is in connected state or not.Other Connection EventsIf a digital optical cable (Fire TV - 1st Generation only), audio headset, or BT A2DP headset is connected to Fire TV, unfortunately there is no reliable way of knowing this in Android Lollipop based Fire OS 5 or later.As such, it is recommended that you provide a User Preference setting in the app that controls this behavior.",

        "title": "Resources for International Locales",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Fire devices have a default locale with a region and language that you can query programmatically. You can increase the reach of your app and improve the experience for users in different locales by providing resources that are not only designed for a specific device, but are also responsive to locale. For example, you may already provide different bitmaps for your app based on the pixel density of the device running the app.You can extend this model and provide different bitmaps for each locale. When you put your resources for each locale in the correct folders, the system finds the appropriate resources at runtime. Creating resource files in this way is a preferred method of localizing your app.  Strings Resources  Drawable Resources  Currency ResourcesStrings ResourcesThe strings.xml file holds the user-viewable strings for your app. The following is a sample definition in strings.xml:&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\t&lt;resources&gt;  \t\t&lt;string name=\"hello\"&gt;Hello!&lt;/string&gt;\t&lt;/resources&gt;In your source code, you can use the following to reference the string resource named “hello”:String helloText = getString(R.id.hello);In your XML files such as layout.xml or AndroidManifest.xml, you can reference the resource by doing the following:&lt;application android:label=\"@string/hello\" &gt;To vary the strings by locale, create a strings.xml file that contains the non-default resources for the locale. Put the file in a directory named values-xx-rYY, where xx is the ISO-639 language code and YY is the ISO-3166-1 region code. The following shows several example directories.\t/res\t/values         (default directory, make sure all references are present)\t/values-fr      (contains French language strings, region not used)\t/values-de      (contains German language strings, region not used)\t/values-en-rGB  (contains English language strings for Great Britain)When the system looks for a string reference, it looks first for a resource that is specific to a region and language. It then tries to match by language. The system falls back to the default strings.xml for the resources that you do not specify in the locale-specific file. For example, if you do not put a “hello” string in values-en-rGB, the system falls back to using the default “hello” string. Important: Make sure that the default directory includes all string references. If the system fails to find a reference after searching the default directory, the system forces your app to close.Drawable ResourcesMany apps have menus, price lists, or instructions written as bitmaps or other graphical data. The following example shows a folder structure for providing dynamic resource handling for drawable resources./res  /drawable  /drawable-fr      (contains French language strings, region not used)  /drawable-de      (contains German language strings, region not used)If you have several drawable directories with resources based on pixel density, you can extend the directory structure to account for language. The following example shows how you can chain together language and pixel density. When you specify multiple qualifiers in a directory name, you must do so in the order listed in the Android documentation in this table.  /drawable-fr-ldpi  /drawable-fr-mdpiTo reuse a drawable asset, for example to put copies of the same bitmap in several folders, you can create an XML file to link to the asset. Suppose you want the resource named “background” in the Great Britain locale to point to a resource in the default drawable directory. You can create a file /drawable-en-rGB/background.xml with the following contents. Any reference to “background” that resolves to the drawable-en-GB directory automatically uses the resource /drawable/background_common.&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;  &lt;bitmap xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"        android:src=\"@drawable/background_common\" /&gt;Currency ResourcesYou can format currency data by locale. Important elements are the currency symbol and the decimal divider, as shown in the following example:  €19,95   // in some European locales  $19.95   // in North AmericaThe following example shows how to display the price of In-App Purchasing items in local format. To fetch a price for an item from the regional store in your app, do the following. This applies formatting only, and does not exchange currency.NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.getDefault());  String formattedPrice = nf.format(19.99f);If you decide to use a locale other than the default, make sure you define it using both language and region, for example en_US, or fr_FR. Otherwise, you may not get the correct formatting. For example, not all countries that use French as primary language have the same currency.",

Amazon Port of ExoPlayer  Android MediaPlayer  VisualOn OnStream MediaPlayer  NexStreaming NexPlayer SDKAmazon Port of ExoPlayerExoPlayer is an open-source media player developed by Google and intended for Android media apps. To learn more about ExoPlayer, see the following resources:  ExoPlayer homepage  ExoPlayer Video from Google  ExoPlayer Developer GuideAmazon has a port of ExoPlayer that is compatible with Fire TV. Instead of integrating the default ExoPlayer into your Fire TV app, use the Amazon port of ExoPlayer. The Amazon port of ExoPlayer provides many fixes, workarounds, and other patches to make ExoPlayer work on Amazon devices.To understand how to use ExoPlayer, consult the standard ExoPlayer resources as listed previously.Download the Amazon Port of ExoplayerAndroid MediaPlayerThe standard Android MediaPlayer classes that handle audio and video playback are supported on Fire TV. These media classes can handle basic media playback in your app; however, for more robust media needs, the Amazon port of ExoPlayer (or one of the paid media player options) is recommended.VisualOn OnStream MediaPlayerYou can use the VisualOn OnStream MediaPlayer to integrate encrypted media playback in your Fire TV app. VisualOn supports AES 128-bit encryption with HLS, PlayReady DRM with the DASH and SmoothStreaming protocol, and AES 608 and 708 closed captions.Unlike with ExoPlayer, you will need to buy a license from VisualOn to use the VisualOn OnStream MediaPlayer in your Fire TV app.NexStreaming NexPlayer SDKThe NexStreaming NexPlayer SDK is supported on Amazon Fire TV.

The following code shows a sample:final String AMAZON_FEATURE_FIRE_TV = \"amazon.hardware.fire_tv\";if (getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(AMAZON_FEATURE_FIRE_TV)) { Log.v(TAG, \"Yes, this is a Fire TV device.\"); } else {  Log.v(TAG, \"No, this is not a Fire TV device.\"); }Reasons for Checking the Fire TV DeviceYou might want to check for the Fire TV device in your code for a number of reasons:  To identify Amazon Fire TV for choosing strings or making special offers (like free Plex service).  To determine whether the app needs to tear down the DRM and HW decoding pipeline in their onPause() method (which is needed for Fire TV – 1st Generation and Fire TV Stick due to poor handling of multiple DRM contexts).  To check whether the TV platform requires a D-pad controller to drive the UI.  To determine whether the app should play 4k Ultra HD.Checking for the ModelPreviously, you could identify Fire TV devices by combining the android.os.Build.MODEL with the Build.MANUFACTURER. As more Amazon-powered devices come to market, this approach will no longer work.If you absolutely have to switch behavior based on a specific Amazon product model, you may use the MODEL name.  Be aware that such code will not likely work on future devices. As such, include a sensible fallback approach for future Fire TV devices based on the com.hardware.amazon.fire_tv feature.The android.os.Build.MODEL value for Fire TV devices is as follows:          Fire TV Stick (Gen 2)  Fire TV (Gen 2)  Fire TV Stick (Gen 1)  Fire TV (Gen 1)  AFTT  AFTS  AFTM  AFTBHere’s a code sample that looks for the model but falls back on the feature:final String AMAZON_FEATURE_FIRE_TV = \"amazon.hardware.fire_tv\";String AMAZON_MODEL = Build.MODEL;if (AMAZON_MODEL.matches(\"AFTS\")) { Log.v(TAG, \"Yes, this is a Fire TV Gen 2 device.\");} else if (getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(AMAZON_FEATURE_FIRE_TV)) { Log.v(TAG, \"Yes, this is a Fire TV device.\");} else { Log.v(TAG, \"No, this is not a Fire TV device\");}",

        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Implementing search in Fire TV requires you to understand some key differences with text search and voice search.  Text Search in Apps  Global Text Search  Voice Search  Avoiding Speech Recognition Errors from Leanback  Alexa Skills and AppsText Search in AppsText search within an app refers to any specific text-search features you have specifically coded within your app. Text search for your app is not available by default on Fire TV.Global Text SearchFire TV provides a global text search available from the Fire TV home screen. The global text search returns results from the Fire TV catalog. In order for your media to appear in global text search results, you must integrate your app’s media into the Fire TV Catalog.Voice SearchFire TV also provides voice capabilities through the voice-enabled remote control. In addition to the Alexa voice capabilities on Fire TV, users can also use natural language to search for TV shows, movies, and other media.Regardless of where users are in Fire TV, when they press the microphone button on a voice-enabled remote and say the TV show or Alexa actions they want, this action initiates a global search using the Alexa cloud service instead of the Leanback library.Media requests through voice always return content from the Fire TV catalog. If you want your app’s media to appear in these results, you must integrate your app’s media into the Fire TV Catalog.If the user already has your app installed, your app’s content can appear directly in the catalog results. If a user doesn’t have your app, a “More Ways to Watch” option appears for users to get your app and view the content. (Note that catalog integration is only recommended as an option for apps whose content is the same for all customers.)Avoiding Speech Recognition Errors from LeanbackBecause Alexa is used for voice interactivity on Fire TV instead of the Leanback library, you must disable any speech recognition with the Leanback library’s SearchFragment class for your Fire TV app. If you don’t disable speech recognition, your app will potentially return errors when users perform searches.In Leanback’s SearchFragment class, the startActivityForResult method looks for the speech recognizer. Since FireTV does not support this speech recognizer, this action produces an error. To avoid the error, override the onCreate() method and comment out the speech recognition callback so that the method does not execute. Here’s an example:setSpeechRecognitionCallback(() -&gt; {    if (DEBUG) Log.v(TAG, \"recognizeSpeech\");    try {        //startActivityForResult(getRecognizerIntent(), REQUEST_SPEECH);    }    catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {        Log.e(TAG, \"Cannot find activity for speech recognizer\", e);    }Here the startActivityForResult method is simply commented out, so the speech recognition feature will not execute and no error will result.Alexa Skills and AppsYou cannot create an Alexa-powered voice search specific to your app, returning media results from your app only. You can access any Alexa skill on Fire TV, but the skills are voice-only experiences. The voice skills do not interact with native apps on Fire TV. As such, there are no ways for an Alexa skill you create to control your app.",

        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Audio playback on Amazon Fire TV is a shared resource. Although apps such as music players can play audio when they are not in the foreground, only one app should be playing audio at once.To manage audio playback across apps, Android provides the concept of audio focus via the AudioManager APIs. This document outlines how to manage audio focus on the Fire TV platform.  General Best Practices for Managing Audio Focus          Run Your App as a Foreground Service      Request Audio Focus      Register to Receive Media Button Events      Create a Focus Change Listener        Handling Audio Focus with Voice Interactions  Code Samples for Handling Audio Focus  Best Practices for Audio-only ApplicationsGeneral Best Practices for Managing Audio FocusFor the best user experience, do the following in your playback app:  Run Your App as a Foreground Service. During playback, run your app as a foreground service to prevent it from being unexpectedly halted by the system.  Request Audio Focus. At playback time, request audio focus.  Register to Receive Media Button Events. When you have the audio focus, register to receive the controller. Release the media buttons if your app loses focus, or when you’re done playing.  Create a Focus Change Listener. Listen for changes to audio focus and respond appropriately.Each of these best practices is explained in the sections below.Run Your App as a Foreground ServiceServices are used to perform operations in the background when the user may not be directly interacting with your app. Media players, especially those that play music, are ideal for services.However, services may be halted unexpectedly by the Fire TV platform if system resources run low. To give your playback app higher priority on the system and prevent it from unexpectedly being killed, make sure you run your app during playback as a foreground service by extending from Service and using the Service.startForeground() method.The startForeground() method requires two parameters that indicate a notification: a notification ID you define, and a Notification object. On Android devices, that notification appears in the notification drawer to indicate to the user that a high-priority service is running.On the Fire TV platform, heads-up notifications (high priority) display for a few seconds and fade out. You can view older notifications in the Notifications Center. You can use the Android Notification API to create a heads-up notification:// define the notificationNotification.Builder builder = new Notification.Builder(getApplicationContext());builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon);builder.setContentTitle(title);builder.setContentText(text);builder.setPriority(Notification.[PRIORITY_HIGH][4]);builder.setType(Notification.Builder.TYPE_MEDIA_INFO);Notification notification = builder.build();// startstartForeground(1, notification);After you’ve stopped playing, remove your service from the foreground with Service.stopForeground(). The boolean parameter indicates whether to remove the associated notification.stopForeground(true);Request Audio FocusAudio output is a shared resource on the Fire TV platform — only one audio stream should be playing at any one time. The Android audio manager uses the concept of audio focus to enable apps to share audio playback, and to pause, stop, or lower the volume in response to other apps needing that focus.An application playing back audio must first request the audio focus with appropriate flags and continue playback only if focus is granted. The app can continue to play audio in the background if and only if it still has audio focus.Request the audio focus with AudioManager.requestAudioFocus(). The request has three parameters: a focus listener (see Creating a Focus Change Listener, below), an audio stream type (such as AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC), and a duration.AudioManager am = (AudioManager) context.getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);int result = am.requestAudioFocus(focusListener, AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN);if (result == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_GRANTED) {    am.registerMediaButtonEventReceiver(MediaButtonReceiver);    // start playback}The duration parameter can be one of several options:      AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN(permanent focus): Use for when you want to hold the focus andcontinue playing audio for the foreseeable future, as with amusic player.        AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT (transient focus): Use for when you want to interrupt any existingaudio playback for a short period of time, and that other playbackshould pause while you are holding the focus.        AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK (transient with ducking): Same as transient, only the existing playback continues with the volume lowered, muted, or the playback paused.        AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE(transient focus, mutes other sounds): Same as transient but mutesother sounds, including system sounds, in a temporary way. If you’reincorporating voice recognition into your app, or if you have amicrophone input, this parameter can be useful.  After audio focus is granted to your app, you can register the handling of media events (such as Next, Fast Forward, Previous, or Play buttons on headsets, external keyboards, or remote controls) with the AudioManager.registerMediaButtonEventReceiver() method (see the next section). This is only necessary for continuous audio playback — typically you don’t need to own the media buttons for transient playback.After you’re done playing, release the audio focus with the method and unregister the media buttons.// playback complete, give up audio focusam.abandonAudioFocus(focusListener);//unregister media buttonsam.unregisterMediaButtonEventReceiver(MediaButtonReceiver);Register to Receive Media Button EventsIf you plan to play audio for more than a few moments (that is, you’ve requested non-transient audio focus), register a media button receiver when your audio focus request is granted.The media button receiver enables the user to control your media playback with the media buttons on the remote control, even if your app is not running in the foreground.Note that registering the media buttons just means your app receives those events before other apps – you must still handle those key events to actually control your media playback.Your media button receiver extends from BroadcastReceiver and listens for an ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON intent. Register your receiver in your Android manifest (in this example, the receiver class is MediaButtonReceiver):&lt;receiver android:name=\"MediaButtonReceiver\" &gt;    &lt;intent-filter&gt;        &lt;action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON\" /&gt;    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;&lt;/receiver&gt;Implement the onReceive() callback in your receiver class to receive and handle media button intents:public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {    if (Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON.equals(intent.getAction())) {        KeyEvent key = (KeyEvent) intent.getParcelableExtra(Intent.EXTRA_KEY_EVENT);        int keycode = key.getKeyCode();        if (keycode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT) {            // next        } else if (keycode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PREVIOUS) {           // previous        } else if (keycode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE) {           // play or pause        }    }}Once you’re done playing, or if you lose the audio focus, unregister the media buttons so that other apps can control media playback when needed.Create a Focus Change ListenerAudio focus is a cooperative resource. Once you’ve been granted audio focus, it is not yours to hold until you’re done with it. If other apps request the audio focus, you must respond to those requests to pause playback or stop playing altogether. See Android’s Managing Audio Focus topic for more details. Note: The Fire TV platform does not support volume control from within your app. Although Android distinguishes between a transient loss of focus with or without ducking (lowering the volume), your app should pause playback for both these cases.Listen for audio focus changes withAudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener and the onAudioFocusChange() method. Create this listener as you would any listener.OnAudioFocusChangeListener focusListener = new OnAudioFocusChangeListener() {    public void onAudioFocusChange(int focus) {        switch (focus) {            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN:                // continue playback and raise volume (if it was previously lowered)                // ...                break;            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS:                // stop playback, de-register buttons, clean up                // ...                break;            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT:            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANIENT_CAN_DUCK:                // pause playback                // ...                break;        }    }}The argument for onAudioFocusChange() is an integer that may be one of the following:      AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN): Your app has gained or regained the audio focus. Continue playback or raise the volume.        AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS: Your app has lost the audio focus (likely permanently). Halt playback and de-register the media button receiver.        AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT: Your app has lost audio focus for a short amount of time.Pause playback.        AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK: Same as transient; pause playback.  Handling Audio Focus with Voice InteractionsWhen users press the Microphone button, system-wide voice capabilities start and cannot be overridden. Your app should pause (implement the OnPause() method) in response to voice interactions. If you need search functionality within your app, you must implement it yourself and provide your own user interface for that function.For audio apps, the voice activity requests a transient audio focus (without ducking – that is, lowering the volume). As such, you should handle the AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT event to accommodate voice search.In addition to handling AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT, your application should handle other audio focus change events as well (AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS and AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK), since any application (not just voice search) might request any kind of audio focus. In short, all audio focus use cases should be handled appropriately.For backwards compatibility with older applications on the Fire TV platform, we send out both an AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK and an AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT when a voice search is initiated. Your applications should handle this use case correctly. Tip: As a best practice, implement all audio focus change events in your app.See the Android documentation on Managing Audio Focus for details on audio focus and audio ducking. For more information about voice search and the results returned from the Fire TV catalog, see Implementing Search on Fire TV.For video apps, your app should pause playback when voice capabilities are invoked (in your OnPause() method). When your app resumes, playback should remain paused until the user presses PLAY. Note: If you need search functionality in your app, you must implement text search yourself and provide your own user interface for the search function.Code Samples for Handling Audio FocusSeveral Java code samples are available that demonstrate how to handle audio focus. The code samples are as follows:  AudioCapabilities.java  AudioDeviceEventReceiver.java  AudioEventManager.java  AudioEventManagerCallbackListener.javaYou can download the code samples here:AudioFocusHandling.zip.These code samples are also available from the SDK download page in the “Other downloads” section.Best Practices for Audio-only ApplicationsIf you have an audio-only application, such as a streaming radio player, the following table provides guidelines about how your app should respond to various events when an audio stream is playing:Event TypeAUDIOFOCUS EVENTListen to Audio Focus Events?Listen to Media Controller Events?Customer/App ExperienceHome button press(none)YesYesAudio stream continues to play.

        "content": "2nd generation Fire TV devices now support standard Android notifications through the Android Notifications API. These notifications appear in a \"Notification Center,\" as described below. However, for 1st generation Fire TV devices, support for standard notifications and the Notifications Center will roll out at a later date.  What Are Notifications?  Types of Notifications Supported on Fire TV          Heads-up Notifications      Toasts      Standard Notifications        Requirements for Notifications  Code Samples  System Notifications  Migrating from the Deprecated Fire TV Notifications APIWhat Are Notifications?A notification is a message to your users that appears outside of your app’s user interface. Fire TV supports the Android Notification API, with some limitations.Typically you use notifications to let users know that you have an update available with your app. The update might be any of the following:  New content available  New levels in a game  New episodes available for an existing series  Live TV channel lineup changed  New game packs available in your app  New functionality  New badges or rewards earned  New releaseYou’re probably used to receiving messages from the various apps on your smartphone. Notifications for your Fire TV apps can provide the same kind of user engagement. The notifications are a way of reaching out to users to encourage them to re-engage with your app in some way.Note that notifications are not Recommendations. Recommendations use a different Android API (which is not currently supported on Fire TV) to recommend content to users, usually on specific rows on the home screen.Types of Notifications Supported on Fire TVThere several types of notifications you can create on Fire TV:  Heads-up notifications  Toasts  Standard NotificationsHeads-up NotificationsFire TV supports Android’s heads-up notifications. Typically on Android devices, heads-up notifications are floating windows that appear at the top of the screen and allow users to interact with the window (such as receiving a call while you’re in another app).On Fire TV, heads-up notifications appear at the bottom of the screen and fade away after a few seconds. Some interaction is allowed while the notification appears. For example, users can click a button or dismiss the notification with the Back button.All undismissed heads-up notifications will be displayed in the Notification Center, where users can review the notifications at their leisure. This also ensures that users will actually see the notifications. (Previously, if users missed the heads-up notification, there wasn’t any way to return to it.)When you create heads-up notifications, you must set the notification as a high priority:.setPriority(Notification.PRIORITY_HIGH) // heads up must be high priorityProgress displays and stacked notifications are not supported on Fire TV. Regarding layouts, heads-up notifications are limited in height to normal layouts only (there are no expanded layouts).ToastsThough rarely used, Fire TV also supports toasts. Toasts are small pop-ups that appear within your app briefly and then disappear, with no ability for the user to interact with the message. Unlike heads-up notifications, toasts are not stored within the Notification Center.Standard NotificationsStandard notifications are informational in nature and do not interrupt the current foreground activity (unlike heads-up notifications, which pop-up in the bottom-right corner of the screen). Notifications from your app are added to the Notification Center as soon as they are raised.The Notification Center appears under the Settings menu. When users have unseen notifications, a little bell appears next to Settings.Within Settings, users select Notifications. This opens what is referred to in the documentation as the Notification Center.The Notifications Center arranges the notifications in a single list ordered by most recent first. The Fire TV Appstore client itself will send notifications when your app has an update (hence you don’t have to worry about pushing these kinds of notifications). In the following screenshot, there are two apps that have updates.When users click the icon, they see the updates available for the app. Users can choose to update the app or not.Notifications should contain enough information to convey the reason for the notification. They can also include an optional intent to launch when the notification is selected. For example, your notification can allow the user to launch your app with a deep link to the specific activity related to the intent.When the update finishes, the user is prompted to launch the app.Users can also turn app notifications on or off on a device-by-device basis. (More granular notification configurations are not possible.) Users can control app notifications by going to Preferences &gt; Notification Settings &gt; App Notifications.Users can also select Do Not Interrupt to suppress heads-up notifications from appearing on the screen. (You will still see standard notifications in the Notification Center and see the bell icon on Settings on the main navigation.)All notifications appear in the Notification Center until the user engages with the notifications, dismisses them, disables notifications for the app, or until the app removes them.A notification that was not dismissed while displayed as a heads-up notification will appear in the Notification Center.Each notification indicates the time or date it was received.As soon as a user visits the Notification Center, whether to click on a notification or not, the bell icon on “Settings” is removed.Requirements for NotificationsThe following table lists requirements for notifications.FeatureDescriptionRequired?  Large Image  A large image used as the tile image in the notification card. This image appears in the Notification Center. The image should be a 16:9 aspect ratio. The actual size of the image container is 228dp with x 128dp, so the image should be at least these dimensions (or larger). Larger images will be scaled down. See setLargeIcon for more details. If a large image isn’t provided, Fire TV will use the large app icon.   Optional  Action  Android intent to launch app or deep-link.  Optional  Title  Title of the notification.   Required  Description  Description of the notification.  Required  Action Text  Text for the Menu button (the default is “Launch now”); this is only included in notifications marked as Urgent.  Optional  Priority  Android priority for the notification (range is -2 to +2). If the priority is +1 or +2 (HIGH or MAX), the notification is considered an Urgent notification. If not included, the default priority is 0.  OptionalCode SamplesFor code samples and technical instruction on how to create notifications, see the Notifications in the Android documentation.System NotificationsFire TV also sends system notifications to users. Although third-party apps can’t replicate or initiate system message notifications, it’s worth mentioning them here. Common Fire TV system notifications might include the following:  Low battery status  Disconnected headphones  Bluetooth pairing  Application download/installation complete  Other system updatesThese notifications appear as small popups in a corner of the screen and can be raised over any content that is on the screen.System notifications will also be stored in the Notification Center (unless users dismiss them in the initial display).Fire TV also provides notifications when your app has an update. These notifications aren’t something you create with your app but rather are triggered by the Fire TV appstore client.Fire TV creates two types of app update messages. A “Required Update” message is a visual prompt on an app icon, indicating that there is a new update available.Another update message is presented to users though an on-device dialogue box. When users start a new session in your app or game, they are presented with the option to “Update Now” or “Launch without Updating” along with details describing what’s new in the update.App Update NotificationAfter the app has been installed, users get a quick notification letting them know it’s ready to launch:Post-Install NotificationMigrating from the Deprecated Fire TV Notifications APIIn the past, Amazon Fire TV included a custom notifications API designed for TV use. As of Fire OS 5, the Amazon Notifications API is deprecated. If your app uses the Fire TV Notification API, those notifications will continue to work, but that API will be removed from the platform at a later date. If your app uses the Amazon Notifications API, we strongly suggest you move to using the standard Android (Lollipop) notification API instead.To migrate your app from the Amazon Notifications API:  Remove all references to AmazonNotification and AmazonNotificationManager as well as to the package com.amazon.device.notification. These can be replaced with the stock Notification and NotificationManager classes in the Android notification API.  References to the AmazonNotification.setType() method and the TYPE_INFO and TYPE_MEDIA_INFO constants should be removed. Android notifications do not specify these types.",

      "specifying-installation-location-html": {
        "title": "Specifying Your App's Installation Location on Fire TV",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The settings in your Android Manifest file determine where your app is installed on Fire devices. Two storage locations are possible:  External storage (such as an SD card)  Internal storage (using the device’s memory)Fire TV Stick doesn’t have external storage, but Fire TV (the set-top box) does provide external storage options through a memory card slot.Generally, your app should specify external storage as the default install location.  Best Practices  How to Specify External Storage  When to Select Internal Storage  Fire TV External Storage Settings  Handling secondary downloads in your app  Specifying Install Location with UnityBest PracticesAs a best practice, most apps should specify preferExternal for the installLocation in the Android Manifest file. If left unspecified, your app will be installed on internal storage.Filling up internal storage can lead to:  Fewer app installs  Poor app ratings  Negative customer experiencesSome users may have abundant space available in external storage, but if an app’s Manifest does not specify preferExternal, the app will be installed internally. As a result, users get prompted with low storage warnings or cannot install the app at all, which leads to user frustration.Selecting preferExternal helps ensure the greatest user base for your app and a better user experience on Fire devices.How to Specify External StorageIn the AndroidManifest.xml of your app, inside the &lt;manifest&gt; tag, add the installLocation attribute and set its value to preferExternal. Here’s an example:&lt;manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"    android:installLocation=\"preferExternal\" ... &gt;    ...&lt;/manifest&gt;The installLocation parameter has several values available:                                                installLocation value             Description                                                    preferExternal                                        Recommended for most apps. Install your app on external storage when available. If external storage is full, install the app to internal storage (if available). The user can manually move the app later by selecting it from Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Games &gt; Manage All Applications.                                            internalOnly                                        Install the app only to internal storage. If there is not enough room in internal storage, the install will fail. The app cannot be manually moved later by the user. Not recommended for most apps. Choose this option only for the types of apps described in the next section.                                                        auto                                        Install to internal storage by default. However, if internal storage is full, install the app to external storage (assuming external storage is available). The user can manually move the app later by selecting it from Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Games &gt; Manage All Applications.                        Note that even though the APK file is installed on external storage, all databases, private user data, optimized .dex files, and extracted native code are stored on internal storage.See App Install Location in the Android documentation for more information.When to Select Internal StorageMost apps should select preferExternal for the installLocation. However, DRM-protected media apps are an exception:  If your app plays DRM-protected media, DRM resources may become unstable if USB storage becomes unavailable.  If your app plays DRM-protected media, either do not include installLocation at all, or set its value to internalOnly.In addition to DRM-protected media apps, the following types of applications should never be installed on external storage:  Services  Alarm Services  Input Method Engines  Account Managers  Sync Adapters  Device Administrators  Broadcast Receivers listening for “boot completed” message  Live Wallpapers (not supported on Fire OS)  App Widgets (not supported on Fire OS)See the App Install Location documentation in Android for more details.Fire TV External Storage SettingsFire TV (Generation 1) supports USB external storage and Fire TV (Generation 2) includes a microSD slot for external storage. On these devices, settings are provided for users to manage connected external storage.Users can also move internally stored apps to the SD card:Handling secondary downloads in your appFor apps that perform their own secondary downloads as part of first run or at any other time, these downloaded files are usually stored where the APK file was installed on the device. If the app was installed on external storage, the APK file will be on external storage.Some applications, particularly games, use secondary downloads containing additional textures, levels, or other asset files. If you are handling this download in your app code, such as part of first run initialization, use the Android PackageManager getApplicationInfo method to retrieve the ApplicationInfo class.The ApplicationInfo class contains the location of the APK (sourceDir) and the public parts of the source directory, including the resources and manifest (publicSourceDir). If the app has been installed on external storage, these paths will point to that location and indicate where users should install the additional downloaded content.If your app uses installLocation=\"preferExternal\" to install a 40MB APK onto external storage, but then stores a 1GB downloaded data file to internal storage because the app uses the ApplicationInfo dataDir path, this would defeat the purpose of using external storage and quickly fill up the device’s internal storage, leading to customer frustration. Therefore make sure the secondary downloads use the sourceDir for the download path.Specifying Install Location with UnityUnity is one of the most popular tools for creating games for the Amazon Appstore. Unity supports setting the install location through the Player Settings Inspector for Android. To configure your app install location on external storage:  From your Unity project, click File-Build Settings….      From the Build Settings dialog, select Android in the Platform list and click the Player Settings… button to display the inspector.            Open the Other Settings section and look for the Install Location setting. preferExternal is usually the default – this is almost always the best choice.      YoYo Games’ Gamemaker:Studio also uses preferExternal as the default for Android projects. Although you can manually change this default, it’s recommended that you leave it as is.Other engines and development frameworks provide similar options. Consult the documentation for the tool you are using to make sure you are using are configured to set the installLocation to preferExternal in the APK manifest.",

All other Android widgets work without modifications, although those widgets may have a different appearance in the Fire TV user interface.Menus and Action BarWhen your app uses Android’s ActionBar, it is important to note that, in order to avoid cluttering the user interface, the action bar items do not appear on the screen. Instead, items from the action bar are displayed in a modal dialog box when the user presses the Menu button on one of the Fire TV remotes or the Fire Game Controller. The user can then pick an Action Item or a Navigation Tab from the dialog.Currently, only the action items, tabs, options menu and sub menus on the action bar are handled. On the launch of any application or activity, the action bar does not show up by default. Pressing the menu button brings up a dialog window containing two listviews arranged side by side, at a max. The left list view contains all the tabs and the one on the right shall contain the action items.Users can navigate between and within the lists with the directional navigation buttons on the remote or game controller. If for an item, a sub-menu exists, then clicking on the item causes its sub-menu appear as a list in the place of its parent. This implementation does not keep track of the menu hierarchy and the navigation state. Pressing Back at any point dismisses the dialog window.You can get a handle to the action bar using the getActionBar() method in the onCreate(Bundle) method for your activity.

        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Because both Fire TV and Android TV use Android, you can push your same Android app out to both the Amazon Appstore and Google Play Store. Making your app available on both Amazon and Google stores can significantly increase the visibility and downloads of your app.However, there are some differences with Fire TV that you need to account for in your code. Some of the differences are due to unique elements in the hardware or services. In some cases one service has features the other doesn’t have, or they use different but equivalent services.As you code for these differences, be aware that you can identify Amazon Fire TV devices and conditionalize your code to target different behavior accordingly.  What is Fire TV and Android TV?  Google Services  LeanBack Support Library  Voice Search  Global Search  Audio Focus  Fast-forward, Rewind, and Menu Buttons  In-app Purchasing  Analytics  SDK Level  Recommendations  Emulators  Notifications API  Accessibility  Appstore  Testing Your AppWhat is Fire TV and Android TV?First, let’s clarify what we mean by Android TV and Fire TV:  Android TV refers to the Android operating system that has been optimized for TV (starting at Lollipop). Android Lollipop and the Leanback Support Library provide features that optimize Android for TV platforms. TV devices themselves can run Android TV as their native OS, or TVs can run Android through set-top boxes. You can learn more about Android TV on Wikipedia.  Fire TV refers to the Fire TV set-top box or stick that run the Fire operating system (OS) on your TV. Fire OS is a fork of Android 5.1 (Lollipop, API level 22) that accommodates Amazon hardware and services. Fire tablets also run Fire OS but do not leverage the features typically used for the “10-foot media experiences” on TV platforms. (Learn more about Fire OS or see the Fire TV Device Specifications.)The important point is that both Android TV and Fire TV are Android-based, so the techniques you implement for your app share far more similarities than differences.The following sections list the differences you need to account for in your code when planning for Fire TV.Google ServicesAny APIs that rely on Google-specific services, such as Google location services, aren’t available on Fire TV. Although there is an Amazon Maps API as well as an Amazon Mobile Ads API, they are not yet supported on Fire TV.LeanBack Support LibraryFire TV supports some but not all of Android’s Leanback Support Library. For example, Fire TV uses TV-specific UI components from Leanback, Leanback widgets will work, and Fire TV will honor intents tagged for the LEANBACK_LAUNCHER. But Leanback’s SearchFragment (described in the next section) is not supported.Voice SearchFor voice search, Android TV uses app controls that rely on Leanback APIs (for example, speech recognition with the SearchFragment). However, voice search on Fire TV does not use Leanback’s SearchFragment. On Fire TV, voice search uses Amazon-specific system controls.No matter where users are on Fire TV (whether on the Launcher or in an app), when users press the microphone button on a voice-enabled remote and say the TV show or Alexa actions they want, this action initiates a global search using the Alexa cloud service instead speech recognition APIs in the Leanback library.Media requests through voice always return content from the Fire TV catalog. See Implementing Search in Fire TV for more details.Global SearchOn Android TV, to integrate your content into global search, you can do so locally through your app using a search results ContentProvider.With Fire TV, to make your content appear in global search results, you must integrate your media content with the Fire TV Catalog. Submission to the Catalog is done through a cloud-based model (rather than locally within your app).Audio FocusIf a user started playing music from a music app prior to starting your app, Fire TV will continue to play music over your app. The Play/Pause buttons will control the music instead of the video in your app.To receive the audio focus, your app must register a MediaButtonReceiver in your the manifest. The MediaButtonReceiver will transfer the audio focus to your app’s media service when your app starts. See Managing Audio Focus for more details and code samples.Fast-forward, Rewind, and Menu ButtonsBoth Android TV and Fire TV have 4-way directional pad (dpad), dpad_center/select, back, and play/pause buttons. However, Fire TV also offers rewind, fast-forward, and menu buttons that you can optionally use.The Menu button on Fire TV invokes the Android context menu, which appears as a list of menu items centered on the screen. You can override the menu button to provide your own custom menu user interface, or for any other purpose.If you only have one menu item, consider using the Menu button as a simple toggle — for example, to turn closed captions on or off. If you do this, consider providing an onscreen hint to expose this feature to your users.In-app PurchasingAndroid TV often uses Google In-App Billing for in-app purchases. For in-app purchases on Fire TV, you use Amazon’s In-App Purchasing (IAP) API. For more information, you can see a detailed comparison of the two.AnalyticsAndroid TV uses Firebase for Analytics. With Fire TV, you can use Amazon Mobile Analytics or another analytics package (Google Analytics, Flurry Analytics, Crashlytics, and so on). Many of these analytics packages are configurable as modules if you build your app with Fire App Builder.SDK LevelWhile Android TV can use the latest SDK (Nougat), Fire TV uses only Lollipop (API level 22) as the minimum SDK level. (Some APIs from Marshmallow have been backported into Fire OS to support certain apps.)RecommendationsAndroid TV lets apps make recommendations on the home screen. This same recommendations functionality is coming to Fire TV and will be available soon (most likely Q2 2017 or sooner).EmulatorsWhen testing out your Fire TV app code, you use an actual Fire TV device (either the set-top box or stick) instead of a virtual emulator. See Connect to Fire TV Through ADB for more details.Notifications APIYou use the standard Android Notifications API for creating notifications for your Fire TV app. Fire TV provides the same toast notifications and persistence model as Android TV. However, in addition to toasts, Fire TV also provides Heads up notifications, which allow interactive buttons.Additionally, instead of putting old notifications in a notification drawer, on Fire TV notifications are stored in a Notification Center. Learn more at Notifications for Amazon Fire TV.AccessibilityFire TV provides VoiceView to make your app accessible to the visually impaired. You can learn more about VoiceView and accessibility here:  Understanding Assistive Technologies for Fire OS  Implementing Accessibility in Fire OSAppstoreAndroid TV devices use the Google Play Store. In contrast, Fire TV uses the Amazon Appstore. Any links you have pointing to the Google Play store will need links to the Amazon Appstore.Testing Your AppYou can test your Android app’s compatibility with Amazon by sideloading your app onto an Amazon Fire TV device. See Connecting to Fire TV Through ADB. You can also test your app with the App Testing Service.When you connect to a Fire TV device through ADB and run your app with Android Studio, a successful app will load and play. If you close your sideloaded app, you can find it by going to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage Installed Applications. Tip: See the Test Criteria for Amazon Appstore Apps for more details on requirements your app needs to meet for the Amazon Appstore.",

        "title": "Amazon Fire TV Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "General  Q: How do I submit my app for the Amazon Fire TV platform?  To submit your app for an Amazon Fire TV device, create an account on the Amazon Apps &amp; Games Developer Portal and submit your app through the portal.    If you already have an app published at Amazon, update that app to include a separate binary APK for Amazon Fire TV. See Using Device Targeting for more information.    Q: Will my app work on the Amazon Fire TV platform?  Your app must be compatible with the specifications for Amazon Fire TV devices. See Device Specifications for detailed device and feature specifications.    Your app must comply the Amazon Appstore Content Policy Requirements. Amazon also recommends that you test your app on your own and submit an update if you discover any problems.    Q:  How can I identify whether my app is running on an Amazon Fire TV device?  A: You can check for the feature amazon.hardware.fire_tv. If you absolutely must look for the Fire TV Gen 1 or Fire TV Gen 2 device, you can check for the MODEL AFTB or AFTS respectively, but always include a fallback for the feature. See Identifying Amazon Fire TV Devices for more information.  Q: Can I sideload my app onto Amazon Fire TV for testing?  Yes, with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).  See Getting Started Developing Apps and Games for Fire TV for more information.   Q: Are Amazon Fire TV test devices available for developers?  Amazon does not provide test devices for developers.    Amazon Fire TV devices are available for purchase on Amazon retail sites in the US, UK, and Germany. Check the product detail pages for country-specific availability.    Q: What specific features does the Amazon Fire TV platform support?  See Device Specifications, Fire tablets for detailed device and feature specifications.  Q: How do I get my app marketed on the Amazon Fire TV platform?  See Marketing Your App.  Q: How can I get more information about the Amazon Fire TV platform?  Please use the Contact Us form to send us your questions.  Q:  Under what circumstances should my app pause, and how do I implement pause behavior?  A: Your app pauses when the Microphone (voice search), Home, or GameCircle buttons are pressed on one of the Fire TV remotes or on the Amazon Fire Game Controller. The Back button also pauses the current activity and resumes the previous activity on the stack, which may or may not be your app.    To handle pause behavior, implement the onPause() method in your activity as you would in any other Android app. In your onPause() method, ensure that you save the user’s state or position, so that when your app resumes the user is in the same place that they were before the pause.    In addition, the following requirements apply to media apps:          Apps that play video should pause playback, and must release all media resources such as decoders immediately on pause, as these limited resources are hardware-based and memory-constrained. See Releasing the Media Player and MediaPlayer.release() for details.      Apps that play audio may continue playing after a pause, but must relinquish audio focus if requested by another app. See Managing Audio Focus for details.        Q:  Can I open an advertisement in the default web browser?  A: Amazon Fire TV does not include a browser app, so links to all URLs (advertisements or otherwise) do not work. You can use the Android WebView if you need to include a link to a web page in your app. Note, however, that the Android WebView requires you to manage your own cookies and authentication, as well as handle input events from controllers. (WebView in Android does support D-Pad navigation, but layout and navigation may need review.)    See the blog post Using WebViews on Tablets with HD Screens for tips on implementing an Android WebView. Although this post is specific to tablets, the advice can also be applied to TV.    Q:  Can I use the Amazon In-App Purchasing API in my Fire TV app?  A: Yes, Amazon’s In-App Purchasing (IAP) API works on all Fire TV devices and with the Fire TV remotes and game controllers. Use App Tester to preview your transactions.  Q:  Can I use Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) in my Fire TV app?  A: You can use Amazon Device Messaging to receive push messages and other data.  Q:  Can I use the Amazon Maps API in my Fire TV app?  A: There are no location services in Amazon Fire TV, so the Amazon Maps API is not supported at this time.  Q:  Can I use the Amazon Mobile Ads API in my Fire TV app?   A: The Amazon Mobile Ads API is not supported on Fire TV at this time.  Q:  Can I link to my app’s details page in the Amazon Appstore?  A: Yes, Amazon Appstore deep links work as they do for other apps. See Linking to the Amazon Client for more information on deep linking. Note, however, that the ability to rate apps is not currently supported by Amazon Fire TV. Your app should not prompt the user for a rating.  Q:  How do I change the onscreen keyboard to a numeric keypad?  A: You can use the standard Android mechanisms for configuring the IME (input method editor) for any EditText widget. In XML, use android:inputType=\"number\":    &lt;EditTextandroid:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"android:id=\"@+id/edittext\"android:inputType=\"number\"/&gt;        Q:  How do I take screen shots on Amazon Fire TV?  A: To take screen shots, connect to the device with adb and use these commands. Substitute the name of your screen shot for filename.png and the directory on your development computer where you want to put the screen shot for /tmp:    adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/filename.pngadb pull /sdcard/filename.png /tmpadb shell rm /sdcard/filename.png        See Taking Screenshots of your Fire TV App for more details.    Q: My app uses Google’s in-app purchasing technology. Will it work on the Amazon Fire TV platform?  No. Services such as Google’s in-app purchasing API require access to Google Mobile Services, which do not work on the Amazon Fire TV platform. For in-app purchasing, Amazon offers an In-App Purchasing API that makes it easy for you to offer digital content and subscriptions in your apps.  Q: Are there any other criteria for distributing apps for Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick in Germany and/or Austria?  Yes. We do not permit apps to be distributed on Amazon Fire TV or on Fire TV Stick in Germany and/or Austria, if the apps enable copying, recording, downloading, storing, or similar actions of any type of video or audio content onto the Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick device, any SD memory card or any connected external storage (where applicable). If we determine that an app contains this functionality, we will not make it available in Germany and/or Austria.Fire OS 5 (Android Lollipop)  Q: Does Fire OS 5 support Android TV and the v17 Leanback Library?  A: Fire OS 5 includes both support for Android TV functionality and the Leanback Library. However, speech recognition with the Leanback library’s SearchFragment class is currently unsupported. See Implementing Search in Fire TV for more details.Media and DRM  Q: What third-party media player SDKs are supported by Fire TV?  A: Any media player SDKs that implement the Android media playback and encryption APIs work on the Amazon Fire TV platform.  Examples of these SDKs include the Amazon Port of the ExoPlayer, the Android MediaPlayer, the VisualOn OnStream MediaPlayer+ SDK, and the NexStreaming NexPlayer SDK. See Media Players for more details.  Q:  What are my options for implementing playback of media encrypted with Microsoft PlayReady DRM?  A: The Amazon Fire TV platform includes support for the Android MediaCrypto class for playing protected media, or you can use a third-party media player SDK that supports PlayReady. Amazon Fire TV supports PlayReady version 2.5 only. (Fire TV devices cannot support PlayReady Security Level 3000 (SL3000) because this was introduced in PlayReady 3.0, and Amazon Fire TV devices support version 2.5 only.)  Q:  Does Amazon Fire TV support PlayReady content that uses encrypted audio?  A: PlayReady content with encrypted video and clear (non-encrypted) audio is supported on Fire TV. Widevine DRM is also supported. See the DRM section on the Fire TV Device Specifications page for more details. If you need to play content with both encrypted audio and video, please contact us for further information.  Q:  How do I decode Dolby Digital audio on Fire TV devices?  A: Both Fire TV and Fire TV Stick contain decoders for Dolby Digital (AC3) and Dolby Digital Plus (eAC3). You should be able to play these formats with the standard Android media player libraries. Note that the DolbyAudioProcessing SDK for Amazon Fire tablets is not supported (or required) for Fire TV devices. For more information about playing Dolby, see Dolby Integration Guidelines.  Q:  Does the device support Secure Boot to verify firmware and OS?  A: Yes.  Q:  Does the OS enforce signature checking of apps?  A: Yes.  Q:  Is output HDCP protected though a secure channel over HDMI?  A: Yes.  Q: Does Amazon Fire TV support customizable closed captioning (CEA-708)?  A: Fire TV has limited platform-level closed captioning support at this time. Media apps are responsible for and must implement a UI that enables viewers to customize  captions through a third-party media playback SDK or their own implementation.  Q: What fonts are available on Amazon Fire TV for use with closed captions?  A: Amazon Fire TV includes limited platform fonts. You must license and embed your own font files for each of the style categories defined by CEA-708.Media Playback  Q:  What are best practices with media playback to preserve resources and memory?      A: Because the media playback resources in Amazon Fire TV are hardware-based and memory constrained, your app must be well-behaved and release the media resources when you are done with them.    Specifically, apps that play video should pause playback and must release all media resources such as decoders immediately in your onPause() method. See Releasing the Media Player and MediaPlayer.release() for details.    If your app plays video through an Android WebView (with the &lt;video&gt; HTML tag), hardware media resources are not currently released by the system when your app pauses or stops. To work around this issue, explicitly release these resources by killing the processes when you implement your onPause() and onStop() methods:    public void onStop() {   super.onStop();   android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid());}        Q: My app plays music in the background. When my app pauses, why does the audio stop playing? OR when my app starts, why does audio from another app keep playing?  A: Your app is not correctly managing audio focus. When your app begins playing it should both request audio focus and register for media button events. When your app relinquishes audio focus (because you’re done playing or because another app has requested it), it should also unregister from media button events. Specifically:          When your app begins playing, request audio focus with AudioManager.requestAudioFocus()      If audio focus was granted, register a media button receiver with AudioManager.registerMediaButtonEventReceiver()      Listen for the loss of audio focus with AudioManager.onAudioFocusChangeListener()      If your app loses audio focus, stop playback and unregister the media buttons with AudioManager.unregisterMediaButtonEventReceiver()        See the following for more details:          Managing Audio Focus (Fire TV docs)      Managing Audio Focus (Android docs)      Allowing applications to play nice(r) with each other: Handling remote control buttons        Q:  Why does my music app keep getting randomly killed when it’s playing in the background?  A: Make sure you are running your music playback app as a foreground service. Background services (the default) are automatically shut down by the system when resources are low. See the Android guide for Media Playback and the startForeground() method in the Service class for details.  Q:  How should I handle the TV being turned off/disconnected with the HDMI cable?  A: The expected behavior for an HDMI disconnect is different for audio and video. See Handling HDMI Events for details.  Q:  During media playback, how do I prevent the device from entering standby or daydream mode (screen saver)?  A: To keep both Amazon Fire TV and the television awake during media playback, set the KEEP_SCREEN_ON flag for your activity, or acquire a wake lock from the power manager. Your app must release all wake locks when it is not actively playing audio or video so that both the device and the television can sleep and preserve power. See the PowerManager and PowerManager.WakeLock classes for details on using wake locks.    Note that if your app plays audio and you set a partial wake lock for your app PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, the television remains on and when idle the device enters daydream mode (displays the screen saver). This is different behavior from a partial wake lock on a mobile device (where it keeps the CPU on, but turns the screen off), as audio playback over HDMI requires the television to be on. Again, make sure you release the wake lock when your app stops actively playing audio so that the television can sleep.    Setting the SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK or SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK flags has no effect on the behavior of the device.    Q:  How can I detect when the device has entered daydream mode (the screen saver is on)?  A: Daydream mode is an Android function. When Amazon Fire TV enters daydream mode it displays the screen saver if the TV is on. Register for Intent.ACTION_DREAMING_STARTED and Intent.ACTION_DREAMING_STOPPED to detect when the device enters or exits daydream.    Note that if your app plays audio but is not a music app, you should pause audio playback when the device enters daydream mode.    Q:  Can I use an Android WebView and the &lt;video&gt; HTML tag for video playback?  A: Yes, with limitations. Hardware media resources are not currently released by the system when your app pauses or stops. To work around this issue implement your onStop() method to explicitly kill the process for your app:    public void onStop() {super.onStop();android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid());}        This issue may also cause instability in the user experience and navigation for your app. Use of a third-party media player SDK is the recommended method for media playback on the device.    Q:  Can I play 4K Ultra HD Videos in my App?      Yes, Fire TV (2nd Generation) can play 4K Ultra HD video when connected to a 4K-supported TV. Fire TV (1st Generation) and Fire TV Stick do not play 4K videos.    Before playing 4K content, your app needs to check whether (1) the device in a Fire TV (2nd Generation) device and (2) whether the connected TV supports 4K. An Amazon 4K Extension Library has been developed to allow you to initiate the 4K mode switch.    Apps that support Ultra HD video will be certified by Amazon to ensure they meet the required customer experience. Typically, certification takes a couple of weeks. See Playing 4K Ultra HD Videos for more details.  Controllers  Q:  The Amazon Fire TV Game Controller does not have media buttons like the previous version did. How do I handle media playback?  A: Amazon Fire TV generates media input events for the analog stick presses (Play/Pause) and for the left (Rewind) and right (Fast Forward) shoulder buttons (L1/R1). If you do not use those buttons in your app or game, make sure you do not capture or throw away those button events so the user can control media playing in the background.    If you repurposed the media buttons on the Amazon Fire Game Controller for other purposes in your app, users of the new Amazon Fire TV Game Controller cannot use that functionality without the buttons. Consider updating your app to use buttons common to both game controllers, and updating your on-screen hints.    Q: How do I manage volume control from the Amazon Fire TV Game Controller?  A: Amazon Fire TV can stream audio to the headphone jack on the Amazon Fire TV Game Controller (current generation devices only). The left and right trigger buttons (L2/R2) are used to control the volume.    Volume control is a system function and cannot be mapped to other buttons in your app. However, if you do not use the trigger buttons in your app or game, make sure you do not capture or throw away those button events so the user can control media playing in the background. If you do use these buttons for other purposes in your app or game, consider providing an on-screen hint that the user can control the volume from the GameCircle screen or the system launcher.    Q:  Can I override the Microphone button on the Fire TV Voice Remote in my app?  A: The Microphone button launches system-wide voice capabilities (requesting a transient audio focus) and cannot be overridden. Your application should handle this audio focus change event (AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT) as well as other audio focus change events too (AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS and AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK), since any application (not just voice) might request any kind of audio focus. In short, all audio focus use cases should be handled appropriately. See Handling Audio Focus with Voice Search for more details.  Q:  What does the Menu button do, and can I override it in my app?  A: By default, the Menu button invokes the Android context menu, which appears as a list of menu items centered on the screen. You can override the menu button to provide your own custom menu user interface, or for any other purpose.    If you only have one menu item, consider using the Menu button as a simple toggle (for example, to turn closed captions on or off), and provide an onscreen hint to expose that feature to your users.    Q:  Why doesn’t the GameCircle overlay for my game appear when I press the GameCircle button on the Fire Game Controller?  A: The GameCircle overlay appears only if:          Your game has implemented the GameCircle API.      Your game has been submitted to the Amazon Appstore, and is categorized as a game.      Your game has been installed on to a Fire TV device from the Amazon Appstore.        The GameCircle overlay does not appear if you have sideloaded your game onto a Fire TV device for testing. You can test your GameCircle implementation in your app before submitting it with Live App Testing.    The GameCircle overlay may also not appear if you have not yet published any leaderboards or achievements AND you’re not using a test account. In this scenario either publish at least one achievement or leaderboard in the Amazon Developer Console, or set up a test account (also in the Developer Console), and use that account to view draft achievements and leaderboards in the GameCircle overlay.    Q:  Why is my activity restarted from scratch when a controller is connected, disconnected or sleeps?  A: These events are handled as runtime configuration changes by Android. To ignore these events in your app, modify your AndroidManifest.xml to include the android:configChanges attribute, and include keys for keyboard, keyboardHidden, and navigation:    &lt;activity android:name=\"MyActivity\"android:configChanges=\"keyboard|keyboardHidden|navigation\"&gt;        See the Android Guide Handling Runtime Changes for information on the configChanges attribute and how to handle configuration changes in your app, if necessary.    Q:  How do I handle game controller disconnects in my app or game?  A: The Amazon Fire TV Game Controller may disconnect from the system if it is idle or if either stick is held at an angle for more than five minutes (to preserve battery life). Other controllers may also disconnect when idle or when battery life runs out. Use the Android OnInputDeviceRemoved listener to handle controller disconnection events. Consider pausing the game or displaying a dialog to let the user know the controller is no longer available.Amazon Fire TV Stick  Q:  What are the differences between Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick?  A: Fire TV Device Specifications lists the specifications for all Fire TV devices.  Q:  How do I adapt my Amazon Fire TV app to Amazon Fire TV Stick?  A: Both Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick run the same platform software. However, because of the more limited hardware on the Fire TV Stick, optimizing your app for performance and stability are critical. Make sure you follow Android best practices for hardware acceleration and performance. Watch out in particular for OpenGL and textures; the Fire TV Stick’s GPU supports OpenGL 2.0 with a MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE of 2048x2048.  Q:  How can I identify a Fire TV Stick device?  A: You can check for the feature amazon.hardware.fire_tv. If you absolutely must look for the Fire TV Stick, you can check for the MODEL AFTM. See Identifying Amazon Fire TV Devices for more information.  Q:  Some of the images/backgrounds in my app are not appearing, or I’m getting grey boxes for those images.  A: This is usually a result of bitmap images or textures that are too large. Fire TV Stick supports textures up to 2048x2048. You may see an error in the logs like this if your app has this problem:    W/OpenGLRenderer( 8941): Bitmap too large to be uploaded in a texture (3840x2160, max=2048x2048)        Also, make sure your images for Fire TV are in the drawables-xhdpi/ folder and not in drawables/. Platform scaling of the default drawables may result in large images that exceed the texture limit.  ",

        "title": "Design and User Experience Guidelines for TV Platforms",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Television user interface design differs significantly from the design for desktop computers, tablets, or phones. These guidelines will help you become familiar with the design principles for a 10-foot UI and help you integrate your application and its design into the Amazon Fire TV user interface.  General Principles          10-Foot UI      Clear, Simple, and Visual      Place Important Content First      Focus on Consumption        Design Guidelines          Screen Size and Resolution      Overscan and the Safe Zone      Color      Typography        Navigation and Input          D-Pad Directional Navigation      Focus and Selection      Text Entry        Screens, Views, and Flows          Home Screen (Launcher)      1D List Views      Detail View      Search      Additional Resources      General PrinciplesUse these principles to guide the design of your app as a whole.10-Foot UITV interfaces are often referred to as 10-Foot User Interfaces (10-ft UI), because the user is viewing the screen from 10 or more feet away. Although the screen itself can be large, the screen resolution is lower, and distance from the screen means a smaller angle of view.The design choices you would make for an application or web page running on a desktop computer, tablet, or phone are fundamentally different, as users typically view those screens from much closer distances.In addition, as the television is used in a more relaxed fashion than a computer, a tablet or a phone, the UI on the TV should not require as much attention and precision. 10-ft UI may require you to wholly rethink the design, layout, and navigation of an existing app.Clear, Simple, and VisualThe design of a screen in a 10-ft UI requires simplicity and clarity, with low information density. Limit the number of design elements or UI components (menus, buttons, images) on the screen, and ensure that those elements are large enough and spaced far enough apart to be read from a distance. Present a clear set of actions or options for each screen.Minimize the amount of text, as users do not read a lot of text on a television screen. Avoid requiring the user to input a lot of information and provide reasonable defaults where possible.Place Important Content FirstPlace the most important content or options first on the screen so they are easily viewable and navigable by the user.Focus on ConsumptionApplications should have a clear focus on getting users to content quickly. Television interfaces are primarily about providing entertainment. When users sit down in front of their television, they don’t want to do extra work. They need simple user interfaces that match their primary goal: “Give me something to watch or listen to or play with right now.”Design GuidelinesUse these guidelines when designing individual screens and views in your app.Screen Size and ResolutionWhen you design an app for a tablet or phone screen, you’re working with screens that have a fixed size and resolution. TV design differs in that the same app can appear in either 720p or 1080p resolutions, on a screen of any size.We recommend for the best possible experience that you design your app and its resources for a full 1080p television screen. The Amazon Fire TV platform scales your resources to the appropriate TV output. For 1080p the screen size is 1920x1080px, the density is 320dpi (“xhdpi”) and the output resolution is 960x540dp (“large”).The Amazon Fire TV platform also supports the standard Android configurations for enabling multiple resource directories for different output parameters, as described in the Android developer guide for Supporting Multiple Screens.When your app runs,  Fire TV loads your resources from the appropriate folder. See Display and Layout for more information on the resource configurations available for Amazon Fire TV.Overscan and the Safe ZoneRegardless of its physical size, TV hardware manufacturers reserve space around the displayable area of the screen. This reserved space is known as overscan. The amount of space a TV uses as overscan varies across manufacturers. That real estate is not available to your app.Although the Amazon Fire TV platform provides a way for the user to adjust for television overscan in the settings, for the safest possible behavior we recommend that you avoid placing any of your app’s UI elements within the outer 5% of any edge on the screen. The focused item and on-screen text, especially, should be fully within the inner 90% (the safe zone) of your user interface.You can display an overscan on your Fire TV through the Developer Options. See System X-Ray.ColorTelevision screens have a higher contrast than computer screens, which can make colors seem more saturated, brighter, and vibrant. The color gamut (the range of colors that can be displayed) is also less than that of a PC screen. In your app, use less saturated colors. Cool colors (blue, purple, gray) work better than warmer colors (red, orange).TypographyBecause television screens must be read from across the room, use larger type sizes for body text (at least 14sp, which is approximately 19px on 720p, 28px on 1080p). Amazon uses Helvetica Neue Regular as the system font.Keep item descriptions or other blocks of text as short as possible, both in content and in line width. Use greater line spacing than you would use on a desktop or tablet screen. Separate text into paragraphs or chunks and write in short, declarative sentences.Navigation and InputNavigation and user input on the Fire TV user interface are both accomplished with one of the Fire TV remotes (Amazon Fire TV Remote or Voice Remote), or with a game controller (either the Amazon Fire Game Controller, or other Bluetooth game controllers) The use of a physical controller instead of mouse, keyboard or touch input makes input and control methods for Fire TV apps less flexible than on other devices.D-Pad Directional NavigationThe Left, Right, Up, and Down D-Pad buttons on one of the Fire TV remotes or on a game controller are used to navigate the user interface of your app. Clearly indicate how users should move through your app’s user interface. A clear up-down and left-right orientation should be immediately apparent to the user and every actionable on-screen element should be reachable with the D-Pad.Focus and SelectionAs the user navigates the user interface with the directional buttons on a remote or game controller, different UI elements highlight to indicate that an element has the focus. Your app should clearly indicate which on-screen element currently has the focus. When users glance away from the TV, upon return their gaze it should remain clear what options they have for navigation.When the user presses Select (or the A button on a game controller) while a UI element has the focus, that element should momentarily change to the selected state.Text EntryWhen the user navigates the focus to a text field, a system keyboard automatically appears. Users can then enter information by selecting letters and numbers with the directional buttons on the remote or game controller. Suggested completions appear and can be selected at any time.Screens, Views, and FlowsThis section describes the patterns for the major screens and views in the Amazon Fire TV user interface, as well as descriptions of the controls used to build them. Use these patterns as a reference if you choose to optimize and integrate the design of your own apps with the system UI.Home Screen (Launcher)The home screen consists of a global navigation menu on the left and a set of content tiles on the right.The global navigation menu is the primary system menu. It appears in a row on the left side of the screen. The global navigation menu allows the user to choose major content categories or other options including Search, Home, Movies, TV, Music, Games, Apps, and so on. Each item in the global navigation menu can be selected with the Up and Down directional buttons.When the user focuses on any item in the global navigation menu, the home view for that node appears on the right side of the screen. Each node has its own home view with its own content. The overall system home view, sometimes called the launcher, is accessible with the Home key on the Fire TV remote or game controller, or by selecting Home from the global navigation menu.Each home view contains multiple horizontal content rows. The title tile for the row indicates the type of content (for example, Most Popular, My Movies, Recommended for You). The remaining tiles show examples of that content. From these content rows, the user can:  Navigate between rows with the Up and Down directional buttons.  Move back to the navigation menu with the Left button.  Choose Select or Right to select a row and view a 1D list for that row.1D List Views1D list views appear when the user selects a content row from a home view. 1D lists contain a single row of items. The title bar indicates the title of the list (for example, Most Popular, My Movies, Recommended for You), and two numbers indicating the number of items in the list and the position of the item that has the focus.The item with the focus in a browse list displays the mini details for that item below the list. Mini details can include basic item information (title, date, rating) as well as options such as Add to Watchlist.From the 1D list, the user can:  Navigate between items with the Left and Right directional buttons. Navigating past the end of the list wraps the focus around to the first item.  Choose an item with the Select button, which shows the detail view for that item.Detail ViewThe Detail view appears when the user selects an item from a browse list. This image shows the Detail view for a movie. The Detail may be different for TV, music, or other content. The Detail view displays information and actions related to a piece of content or other item.The actions under the description provide possible actions for this item. The actions available vary depending on the user’s subscription status (for example, whether they are an Amazon Prime member) as well as content availability.The discovery menu on the left side of the screen provides additional related information about the item (for example, Cast, Trivia, or Reviews).SearchThe Search menu item on the home screen opens the search screen, from which users can access voice search or text search. Search is also accessible with the Microphone button on the Amazon Fire TV Voice Remote, and appears in an overlay on the current app or content.For text search, the user moves LEFT and RIGHT through the alphabet, pressing SELECT on each letter to type a search query. Possible results appear in a list below the query.Global search is provided system-wide and is not customizable for individual apps. Developers may implement their own in-app search, but it is not included in the global search function.Additional ResourcesFor more information on UX best practices when designing for the ten-foot experience, see Android TV.",

        "title": "Amazon Fire TV Development Framework Comparison",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "If you’re planning to build a media-based app for Amazon Fire TV, Amazon provides two frameworks that can help accelerate the development of your app. Each framework is oriented toward developers with particular skill sets:  Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV: Intended for web developers building web apps using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  Fire App Builder: Intended for Android developers building native apps using Java.In addition to using different types of code, the two frameworks have somewhat different features. See the Feature Comparison for more details.  Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV  Fire App Builder  Feature Comparison  Transitioning from Web Apps to Android AppsWeb App Starter Kit for Fire TVThe Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV (available on Github here) is a starting point for creating media-oriented apps for Fire TV using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The web apps can then be packaged using the Amazon Developer Portal to create Fire TV apps that are available in the Amazon Appstore, indistinguishable from native apps.With WASK, you start with a base app template that contains specific media functionality (for example, support for Media RSS or JSON feeds, or support for online video providers such as YouTube or Brightcove). You then customize this template by changing settings files or adding extended functionality using standard web technologies — JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.Baked into the WASK template is the code needed to provide the large-screen experience consumers expect, as well everything needed to pass Amazon Appstore testing during the app submission process. At the bare minimum, you only need to provide a feed of media files, which the app will use to display a selectable list of categories and a rotating carousel of media content.Here’s a screenshot of a simple layout:While customizing or extending the basic WASK template, you can test your app using the Amazon Web App Tester. This is a Fire TV app used to test web apps on an actual device. The Web App Tester uses the same native app wrapper and web engine that will be used when the app is published, giving you an accurate preview of your app during development.When your app is ready, you can use the Amazon Developer Portal to submit your app to the Amazon Appstore and have it published within minutes, with no native coding needed.After signing up online, filling in the basic app details, and uploading thumbnail and preview images, you have a choice about where to host your app. You can either host the app’s asset files on your own web server and submit just the URL, or you can upload the assets to Amazon’s servers, where it will be bundled into a standalone packaged app.After you have submitted your app, it will go through an Amazon ingestion service, and you will be notified when your app is published.For a video tutorial on creating a WASK app from a YouTube feed, see the following video:To learn more, see The Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV. Some examples of Fire TV apps built using WASK include Acorn TV, Urban Movie Channel, and Euronews.Fire App BuilderFire App Builder (available on Github here) provides a Java-based framework that you can use to easily and quickly build streaming media Android apps for Amazon Fire TV. In contrast to the HTML5/CSS3/JS used with WASK, Fire App Builder uses Java Android code.With Fire App Builder, you work in Android Studio, connect to your Fire TV device through Android Debug Bridge (ADB), and generate an APK (Android Package Kit) file to upload to the Amazon Appstore.Although Fire App Builder uses Android APIs (particularly the Leanback Library), you do much of the configuration and customization through JSON and XML files. For example, through JSON and XML files, you can configure more than a dozen components to add to your app. Components provide out-of-the-box functionality for analytics, ads, authorization, purchasing, and media players.Fire App Builder minimizes a dependence on Java expertise as much as possible, but for more deep-level integration, you can build on top of Fire App Builder. You can add your own custom Java classes to extend functionality through common interfaces and other code. (If you don’t care to do any custom Java programming, though, you don’t have to.)With Fire App Builder, your media feed can be JSON or XML, in any structure using any tag names. When you configure Fire App Builder, you’ll write query syntax (using JSON Jayway syntax or XPath expressions) to target the various elements of your feed.Your feed can also require tokens for media protected by DRM. Support for YouTube-based feeds and other video hosting services is on the roadmap but not currently included.You have a lot of control to adjust the colors, layout, typography, and more — all by editing XML or JSON files where these settings have been extracted.Here’s a screenshot of a sample app built using Fire App Builder:A more compressed homepage layout is also available.To learn more, see the Fire App Builder documentation. For a sample app built with Fire App Builder, see the Hallmark app.Feature ComparisonThe following table compares Fire App Builder and WASK features. Note: If a framework doesn’t have a feature, it doesn’t mean the framework won’t support it. It just means the feature isn’t already integrated in the code. Usually you can easily insert the third-party code needed to support these services.CategoryFeatureFire App BuilderWASK  Code Base  Java/Android      HTML5/CSS3/JS      Feed Formats  JSON feeds      Media RSS XML Feeds      Custom XML Feeds      App Delivery Options  Installed as APK on device      Hosted app directly from URL      Media Types  HLS, DASH, Smooth Streaming, MP4      DRM-protected media      Live streams      Media Providers  YouTube      Brightcove      Kaltura      Ooyala      Media Players  Amazon Media Player      Brightcove      Purchasing  In-App Purchasing      Authentication  Login with Amazon      Facebook Authorization      Adobe Primetime      Ad Services  Freewheel Ads      VAST Ads      Analytics  Omniture Analytics      Google Analytics      Crashlytics      Flurry Analytics      Global Catalog Search  Integration into the Fire TV catalog for global voice search.    Again, you can add the services and features you want into either framework. The code is open (and open source), and you’re free to enhance, extend, or otherwise build on top of the framework’s code.Transitioning from Web Apps to Android AppsSome companies prefer to start out with a web app (with WASK) and later transition to a Java Android app (such as with Fire App Builder). Note that when you submit an app to the Appstore, you select the app type (whether web app or Android app).Once you submit an app, you can’t transition from one app type to another. If you started out with a web app and wanted to upload a new version that was an Android app, you couldn’t do this. You would need to upload a separate app entirely, which would mean losing any existing users.If you’re planning to make this transition from web app to Android app, consider using Cordova with your web app. Cordova allows you to wrap your web app as an APK and submit the web app as an Android app. If you later decide to go entirely native with an Android app, you can publish a new version of your Android app in the Appstore.",

        "title": "What Is Fire OS?",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "Fire OS is the operating system that runs Amazon’s Fire TV, tablets, and other devices. Fire OS is a fork of Android 5.1 (Lollipop, API level 22), so if you have an Android app, it will most likely run on Amazon’s Fire devices.As a developer, you might not have to adjust your Android code at all to publish your app on Amazon’s platform. You can test your app here and see if it everything simply works.  Differences in Services  Devices and Fire OS VersionsDifferences in ServicesThe way Fire OS differs from Android is in the services. Instead of using Google’s services (for activities such as browsing, location, messaging, payments, and so on), Fire OS uses Amazon’s services. Most notably, Amazon uses the Amazon Appstore to list your app while Google uses Google Play.If your Android app connects into Google’s ecosystem of services, porting your Android app to the Fire OS platform will require you to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem of services instead. Additionally, Fire OS supports only Android Lollipop (API Level 22).When you’re building your app, follow the standard Android documentation. Where there are differences to account for with Amazon’s Fire OS platform, they’re noted in the documentation on this site.The goal is to provide as much parity as possible with Android (minus Google’s services) so that you don’t have to learn another development platform or make changes to your existing Android app.Devices and Fire OS VersionsMost Fire devices receive over-the-air updates to get the latest version of Fire OS automatically. Not every Fire device receives a push of the same Fire OS version at the same time. Sometimes the updates roll out to different devices at different times. But for the most part, Fire devices largely run the same version.

        "content": "To get started building apps for Fire TV, first decide whether you want to build an Android app or web app:  Android App: If you’re an Android Java developer, you can use existing tools (like Android Studio) and frameworks (including Unity) to develop apps and games for the 10-foot experience. Sample code, documentation, and guidelines are available to help you make the most of your apps. If you’re building a streaming media app, you can use Fire App Builder — a Java-based Android starter kit — to get up and running quickly.  Web App: If you’re an HTML5 web developer, you can leverage the Amazon WebView to develop apps and games. You have the option to build HTML5 web apps, Cordova apps using the Fire OS port, or hybrid apps. If you’re building a streaming media app, you can use the Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV to get up and running quickly. Tip: For an in-depth comparison between Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV (WASK) and Fire App Builder, see Fire TV Development Framework Comparison.Additionally, consider your skill set. Are you Java-based Android developer, or an HTML5/web developer? Choose an approach that aligns with your expertise and app requirements.  Android App Development for Fire TV  HTML5 Web App Development for Fire TV  APIs for Your Fire TV App  Device and Media Specifications  About the Fire TV Documentation  Fire TV ForumsAndroid App Development for Fire TVFor Java-based Android developers, Fire TV uses the same tools, IDEs, and APIs you’re already used to for Android development. To get started, see Fire App Builder, which is a starter kit for building Java-based Amazon Fire TV and Android apps. Fire App Builder is designed for streaming media TV apps (not games).If you’re building your own app from scratch, see these topics:  Setting Up Your Development Environment: If you’re new to Android development, this page helps you get started.  Connecting to Fire TV Through ADB: Connect your development computer to a Fire TV device over ADB, either via the network or a USB cable.  Installing and Running Your App: Install, run, and uninstall your app on a Fire TV device for testing before you submit it to the Appstore.If you’re an experienced Android developer, also check out this list of what’s different about developing on Fire OS.HTML5 Web App Development for Fire TVIf you’re an HTML5 web app developer building a streaming media app, you can use the Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV (WASK). WASK is an open source project designed to get you up to speed quickly with a simple media-oriented app for Fire TV. This starter kit includes an example user interface designed for the 10-foot experience, support for the Fire TV remote control, and sample components that you can use to create and customize your own media app.If you’re building your HTML5 web app from scratch, see Getting Started with Web Apps for Fire TV.APIs for Your Fire TV AppWhen you build your Fire TV app, you can also implement other Amazon APIs to provide a more robust experience:  In-App Purchasing API: When customers buy Fire TV devices and register with their Amazon accounts, they are already set up with their Amazon payment profiles and are ready to purchase apps or in-app items with no further effort.

        "title": "Connecting to Fire TV Through ADB",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "You can use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to connect your development computer to an Amazon Fire TV device or stick for installing, testing, and debugging your apps.Before you use ADB to connect to Fire TV or Fire TV stick, complete the following sections: Note: Android Debug Bridge is provided by the Android Open Source Project, not by Amazon.  Step 1. Enable Debugging on Amazon Fire TV  Step 2. Set Up Android Debug Bridge          Mac OS X      Windows        Step 3. Add Android Debug Bridge to Your Path          Mac OS X      Windows        Step 4: Options for Connecting ADB          Connect ADB Through the Network      Connect ADB Through USB        Update ADB  Run Your App  Troubleshooting  Next StepsStep 1. Enable Debugging on Amazon Fire TVYou must enable both ADB and debugging on your Fire TV device before you can connect to it:  From the main screen of your Fire TV, select Settings.  Select Device &gt; Developer Options.  Turn on ADB Debugging.      (Optional) If you plan to connect your computer to your Fire TV device using a USB cable, turn on USB Debugging.     Note: When USB Debugging is enabled, the USB port is unavailable for other uses such as external storage or input devices. To re-enable the USB port, turn off USB debugging.    Turn on Apps from Unknown Sources.Step 2. Set Up Android Debug BridgeAndroid Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line utility for running and managing Android apps on your device or emulator. ADB is available when you install Android Studio, but Windows users will need to install a special USB driver.Mac OS XNo action is required for ADB to work on Mac OS X.WindowsIf you’re on Windows and want to connect your computer to Fire TV through a USB cable, you need to install a special USB driver to connect your computer to a Fire TV device through ADB. The driver supports all the Fire TV platforms. To install the driver:  Download the USB file and extract the zip file’s contents.  Double-click the FireDevices_Drivers.  Complete the installation dialog boxes as prompted. Note: The USB driver is only certified through Windows 8.1. If you’re on Windows 10, you will need to explicitly accept that you are installing from an “un-certified source.”Step 3. Add Android Debug Bridge to Your PathYou need to add ADB to your PATH so you can more easily execute adb commands. (Your PATH is an environment variable used to specify the location of the program’s executable. If you don’t add ADB to your PATH, running adb commands will require you to browse to the &lt;Android SDK&gt;/platform-tools directory to run adb.)Mac OS XTo add ADB to your PATH on Mac:      Get the path to your Android SDK platform-tools directory:                  Open Android Studio and click the SDK Manager button .        The location to your Android SDK appears near the top next to Android SDK Location. For example: /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk        If this is your first time opening Android Studio, there isn’t an SDK Manager button. Instead, at the Welcome to Android Studio prompt, click Configure &gt; SDK Manager and provide the location to the Android SDK.            Copy the path to the SDK and paste it somewhere convenient, such as a text editor.      Add /platform-tools to the end of the path you copied in the previous step. (“platform-tools” is the directory containing the adb executable.)      Copy the full path to your clipboard.            Use the following command to add adb to your .bash_profile, replacing /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/ with your path to your Android SDK.    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile        Your .bash_profile file is usually in your user directory, which you can find by typing cd ~ (change to your user directory). Then type ls -a (list all) to show all files, including hidden ones.    If the file isn’t there, simply create one. You can then type open .bash_profile to see the paths listed. One of the lines should be something like this: export PATH=$PATH:/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/.        Restart any terminal sessions, and then type adb. If you successfully added ADB to your path, you will see ADB help info rather than “command not found.”  WindowsTo add ADB to your PATH on Windows:      Get the path to your Android SDK platform-tools directory:                  Open Android Studio and click the SDK Manager button .        The location to your Android SDK appears near the top next to Android SDK Location. For example: C:\\Users\\&lt;your user name&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools        If this is your first time opening Android Studio, there isn’t an SDK Manager button. Instead, at the Welcome to Android Studio prompt, click Configure &gt; SDK Manager and provide the location to the Android SDK.            Copy the path to the SDK and paste it somewhere convenient, such as a text editor.      Add /platform-tools to the end of the path you copied in the previous step. (“platform-tools” is the directory containing the adb executable.)      Copy the full path to your clipboard.        Click Start and type view advanced system settings in the search box.  Click View advanced system settings.  When the System Settings dialog opens, click the Environment Variables button.  Under System Variables (the lower pane), select Path and click Edit.      Do one of the following:          On Windows 7 or 8, move your cursor to the farthest position on the right, type ; and then press Ctrl+V to insert the path to your SDK that you copied earlier. It may look like this: ;C:\\Users\\&lt;your user name&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools. Click OK on each of the three open dialog boxes to close them.      On Windows 10, click the New button and add this location.        Restart any terminal sessions, and then type adb. If you successfully added ADB to your path, you will see ADB help info rather than “command not found.”Step 4: Options for Connecting ADBYou can use ADB to connect the Fire TV or Fire TV stick to your computer in two ways:  Connect ADB Through the Network. With this option, you connect using either a wired Ethernet or WiFi network connection. Both your computer and the Fire TV device must be on the same network for a network ADB connection to work.  Connect ADB Through USB. With this option, you use an A-to-A USB cable to establish a direct USB connection. Note: The following instructions apply to Generation 2 devices that have a more updated user interface. If you have a generation 1 device, the menu locations differ slightly.Connect ADB Through the NetworkYou need the IP address of your Fire TV device on your network to connect ADB to it.  If you haven’t already done so, connect your Fire TV device to a network (the same network that your computer is on). To do this, from the Fire TV home screen, go to Settings &gt; Network and select a network.  From the Fire TV home screen, select Settings.      Go to Device &gt; About &gt; Network. Make a note of the IP address listed on this screen.     Tip: Copy this IP address onto a convenient and visible place if you plan to connect regularly via the network.        Open a terminal window.    On a Mac, you can open Terminal by pressing Cmd + spacebar and then typing Terminal. On Windows, you open the Command Prompt usually by typing cmd in your program search. (The exact steps vary based on your Windows version.)    Make sure your Fire TV device and your computer are on the same network. You can use either a wifi network or a wired network.      Run the following commands, where &lt;ipaddress&gt; is the IP address of the Fire TV device noted in the previous section:    adb kill-serveradb start-serveradb connect &lt;ipaddress&gt;         Note: Make sure you added ADB to your PATH, as described in Add Android Debug Bridge to Your Path. Otherwise you will need to cd (change directories) to the platform-tools directory first and use./adb on a Mac or adb on Windows to run adb commands.    If the connection was successful, ADB responds with the message:    connected to &lt;ipaddress&gt;:5555            Verify that the Fire TV device appears in the list of devices:    adb devices        ADB responds with the message:    List of devices attached&lt;ipaddress&gt;:5555  device      If the serial number does not appear after running adb devices, update ADB and then repeat the steps here. Tip: You don’t always need to kill and start the server with ADB. Usually you can just run the adb connect &lt;ipaddress&gt; command.Connect ADB Through USBTo connect your computer to Fire TV through USB, you need an A-to-A USB cable. Note that you must have a Fire TV, not a Fire TV Stick, because only Fire TV (the box) has the USB cable port.  If you’re on Windows, install the USB driver as described in Set Up Android Debug Bridge.  Connect your Fire TV to a USB port on your computer.      Run the following commands:    adb kill-serveradb start-serveradb devices      After the last command, ADB responds with the following message, where &lt;serialno&gt; is the serial number of the device:List of devices attached&lt;serialno&gt; deviceIf the serial number does not appear after running adb devices, update ADB and then repeat the steps here.After ADB connects your computer to your Fire TV device, when you open Android Studio and click the Run App button, you’ll be prompted with a dialog box like this:In this example, “Amazon AFTS” refers to Fire TV (Generation 2).Update ADBIf your device isn’t listed when you type adb devices, try updating ADB:      Open a terminal session and navigate to your Android SDK tools directory.    In Android Studio, you can see the installation directory by going to Tools &gt; Android &gt; SDK Manager or by clicking the SDK Manager button . The directory is listed next to Android SDK Location.        In your Terminal or Command Prompt, change directories (cd) to your Android SDK directory, and then cd one level down to tools. (The tools directory is contained within the SDK directory.)        Run one of the following commands to update ADB:    Mac:    ./android update adb        Windows:    android update adb        You receive a message that says ADB has been updated.  Run Your AppAfter you have connected your computer to your Fire TV device through ADB, you can build and run your app on the Fire TV device. In Android Studio, click the Run App button .TroubleshootingIf you receive a message such as the following: unable to connect to 192.168.0.6:5555: Operation timed outorerror: device offlinetry any of the doing the following:  Make sure both Fire TV and your computer are using the same network and router.  When connecting wireless with adb connect &lt;ipaddress&gt;, make sure you’re typing the IP address correctly, with all the required dots .  Close Android Studio and any other emulators or USB cable connections.  Kill (adb kill-server) and restart (adb start-server) the server.  Restart Fire TV (Settings &gt; Device [or System] &gt; Restart).  Restart your router.  Update ADB.

You can set a metric’s value to any String you want, but keep in mind that it may be truncated. System X-Ray displays each metric in the following format: [name]:[value].A metric’s default color is gray. If you choose to change the color, you will need to add an extra to the Intent. The name of the extra must be Color1, Color2, or Color3. The value can be red, yellow, green, or blue. The metric name and color name must have the same number in order for the color to apply. For example, Metrics1 will get Color1. The color values are independent of each other — you can have more than one metric with the same color.Now that the Intent is set up, you can call the sendBroadcast(Intent) method. If System X-Ray is enabled, it will add a section called App and display the metrics defined in the Intent. If you want to change the value or color of a metric, you must recreate the Intent with the new value or color and send it again.If you are tracking multiple metrics in System X-Ray, you must resend the status of all of them, even if they don’t all change, as System X-Ray does not cache a metric’s state. Otherwise, the metrics you don’t send will be removed from System X-Ray.Examples of Custom MetricsLet’s walk through a few examples of ways you can use this feature.Static InformationIf you test your app on multiple Fire TV devices or use different WiFi networks, you might want to see which Fire TV model you are testing, or the SSID of the WiFi network the Fire TV is using. As your app starts up, you could get this information and send it to System X-Ray. The following code shows a sample of how to show static information:private void updateMetrics(Context context, String buildModel, String ssid) {    // Initialize Intent    Intent intent = new Intent(\"com.amazon.ssm.METRICS_UPDATE\");    intent.putExtra(\"com.amazon.ssm.PACKAGENAME\", context.getPackageName());    // Add metrics    intent.putExtra(\"Metrics1\", buildModel);    intent.putExtra(\"Metrics2\", ssid);    // Send    context.sendBroadcast(intent);}The following image is an example display from the above input. In this image, System X-Ray shows that the Fire TV device model is AFTS, which is the 2nd generation Fire TV box. It also shows that Fire TV is connected to the Guest network.ThresholdsYou might want to track a metric that can cross different thresholds. For example, let’s say your app has video content and you want to track dropped frames during video playback. You might consider less than 5 drops to be green, 5-9 to be yellow, and 10 and higher to be red.As you update the number of dropped frames, you change the color to match the threshold. The following code sample shows how show a threshold:private void updateMetrics(Context context, int numFrameDrops, String frameDropStatus) {    // Initialize Intent    Intent intent = new Intent(\"com.amazon.ssm.METRICS_UPDATE\");    intent.putExtra(\"com.amazon.ssm.PACKAGENAME\", context.getPackageName());    // Add metrics    intent.putExtra(\"Metrics1\", \"FrameDrops:\"+numFrameDrops);    intent.putExtra(\"Color1\", frameDropStatus);    // Send    context.sendBroadcast(intent);}Here are screenshots of what the different thresholds look like:EventsEvent logging is useful, but you might want a visual way to track when an event last occurred. For example, perhaps testing reveals that an intermittent Exception is thrown after 3 hours of video playback. Here’s a sample of how to configure an event:private void updateMetrics(Context context, String message, String time) {    // Initialize Intent    Intent intent = new Intent(\"com.amazon.ssm.METRICS_UPDATE\");    intent.putExtra(\"com.amazon.ssm.PACKAGENAME\", context.getPackageName());    // Add metrics    intent.putExtra(\"Metrics1\", message);    intent.putExtra(\"Color1\", \"Red\");    intent.putExtra(\"Metrics2\", \"Time:\"+time);    intent.putExtra(\"Color2\", \"Red\");    // Send    context.sendBroadcast(intent);}In the following screenshot, System X-Ray displays the Exception, along with the time it occurred.See AlsoFor more details, see the following:  System X-Ray on Fire TV  Developer Tool Options on System X-Ray",

Although the same information is displayed graphically in real-time through the System X-Ray overlay, Record &amp; Share takes this information and stores it into a history that you can dump to the command line.To use Record &amp; Share, first toggle the Record &amp; Share setting in the Developer Tools Menu to On. You’re then prompted to select the Record Settings:These properties control the following:  Interval: The time between two recordings: 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, 16 seconds, or 32 seconds.  Duration: How long the data gets stored in the database: 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, or 16 hours.The default (2s interval, 1 hr duration) means that every 2 seconds, statistics will be recorded and stored in the database.

From the Developer Options Tools menu, select Record &amp; Share, and then click the menu button on your remote.SafezoneSome TVs use overscan with their display. Overscan means the TV displays some information off the edges of the visible screen (to accommodate discrepancies in monitors). You should not display important information in the overscan areas.To make the overscan areas visible, you can turn the SafeZone switch to On. This will make the overscan areas apparent so you can avoid displaying any information in these areas.Note that Fire TV Stick (Generation 2) does not include screen size calibration. If the screen display doesn’t fit correctly on the TV screen, the overscan area may not show accurately.Developer Options Note: This feature is still in development. More information will be released shortly about this feature.Currently some select third-party apps, such as Netflix and HBO Go, display recommendations on the Fire TV home screen in specific rows.Developer Options allows you to turn on a row called “Recommended By Your Apps” (displayed below the Netlix and HBO Go rows). This “Recommended By Your Apps” row will show recommendations sent from third-party apps.Currently, turning this row on shows only recommendations that your own app sends. When the feature is fully released, it will show recommendations from all third-party apps the user has installed (excluding some apps such as Netflix and HBO Go, which display recommendations on their own rows).Launch Network AdvisorLaunches a network analysis window that checks your network connection strength, channel, and other details.

After you turn on System X-Ray, a long rectangular overlay appears on the screen showing different kinds of information:The System X-Ray overlay remains in place as you change apps or navigate around on Fire TV. The System X-Ray overlay is divided into four sections:  Display (DIS)  CPU (CPU)  Memory (MEM)  Network (NET)Display (DIS)The Display section shows the following:  HDMI Mode: Shows the physical height of display in pixels and the refresh rate in frames per second. For example, if the Display shows “1080p 60,” it means 1080 pixels is the physical height of the display, and 60 is the refresh rate in frames per second.  HDCP: Shows the HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) version used by Fire TV to encrypt content that is sent through the HDMI cable to the television.Note that Amazon Fire TV allows users to change their resolution by going to Settings &gt; Display &amp; Sounds &gt; Display &gt; Video Resolution. However, regardless of the resolution users select, an app can change the user’s selected resolution due to network or system resource reasons to give users a better experience. For example, when the YouTube app plays video, if your network connection is slow, the app might lower the resolution to ensure the playback is still smooth.CPUThe CPU (Central Processing Unit) section shows the % CPU usage of each core of the device at real time with different colors. Each column represents a different core. The CPU usage is depicted as follows:  0% to 33% (low utilization) shows in green  34% to 66% (moderate utilization) shows in orange  67% to 100% (high utilization) shows in redIf an Amazon Fire TV device only has two cores (as with the Fire TV Stick), only two columns will appear.CPU utilization can help identify CPU-intensive apps. A core that shows consistently heavy usage may indicate a need to make a process multi-threaded.MemoryThe Memory section has a bar with the labels App (blue), Other (gray), and Available (white):  Blue section: App — shows the memory usage (specifically, the Proportional set size (PSS) of the foreground application, not the GPU memory) and the package name of the foreground app. The package name of the foreground app is displayed below the bar. If you’re on the home screen, com.amazon.tv.launcher appears as the app name.  Gray section: Other — shows the memory usage by other applications.  White section: Available memory — shows the available (free) memory in the device.In this example, 44.7 MB of memory is used by the Fire TV launcher, 744.8 MB is used by the whole system, and 849.3 MB is still available.The Memory information can be used to identify issues such as:  Memory leaks in an app  Excessive memory consumption  Low memory conditions on the deviceNetworkThe Network section shows the strength of the WiFi signal along with the download rates across the entire device and for the visible app. The labels are as follows:  RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication): Shows how strong the WiFi signal is, measured in dBm. The bar indicates the signal strength and is color-coded using the same color coding scheme as the CPU section to indicate the severity of a problem (green is strong, orange is average, and red is weak). The number is always negative – with better signal strength, the number moves closer to 0. If the Amazon Fire TV has a wired connection and is not using WiFi, RSSI is not shown.  System: Measures how many bits per second are being actively downloaded to the device (including both visible and background apps). This is not the available bandwidth. If 0 bps is displayed, no data is being downloaded at the moment.  Visible: Measures how many bits per second are being actively downloaded by the visible (also called foreground) app. This number will never be higher than the system download speed.The Network section can be used to diagnose issues such as:  Connectivity issues  Slow download speeds  Lower quality streams (selected by the media player)See AlsoFor more details, see the following:  Developer Tool Options on System X-Ray  Customize System X-Ray Metrics",

        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "You can customize your web app for Fire TV in the following ways:  You can code for device-specific appearance or behavior and have your app detect the device on which it is running.  You can customize navigation and the way focus is indicated.In addition, you can scale up an app developed for a 720p display so it takes full advantage of Fire TV’s 1080p display.  Providing a Device-Specific Experience  Using a CSS to Customize the Appearance of Your Web App  Customizing Focus and Navigation in Your Web App  Displaying an App Developed in a 720p EnvironmentProviding a Device-Specific ExperienceAn app or web page can read the user agent string to detect a specific platform and then provide a specific user experience. User agent strings can include the version of the host operating system, the version of the browser, and other information. The user agent strings for the web app platform on FireTV are nearly identical to those on Fire tablets, but with a differing device model identifier. Also see the following sources of information:  For a list of non – Fire TV user agent strings, see the “Web App Development” section of Amazon Web Apps Frequently Asked Questions.  For the rules for the device model and how to detect current and future Fire TV devices, see Identifying Fire TV Devices.   Using a CSS to Customize the Appearance of Your Web AppIt is important that focused items on a page are styled in a way which clearly signifies that a subsequent press on the center button would select it. The default selection indicators (yellow border and/or blue background) are generally not recommended and should be customized on a per-application basis.  To define this styling, developers should use the CSS focus property.button:focus {    border : #ffffff 2px solid;    outline : 0;}Some elements when focused will show a blue highlight background. The following CSS property should remove it; however, note that any element this is applied to will have a transparent background which isn’t always desired (input text field, for example).*:focus {    outline:none;    background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);}For information on the design guidelines for Fire TV web apps, see Design and User Experience Guidelines.Customizing Focus and Navigation in Your Web AppIf you want your web app to handle the selection highlighting or directional navigation on its own, simply capture the key event and consume it. For a working example of capturing key events and customizing navigation, see the template app in the Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV, which is available on GItHub at https://github.com/amzn/web-app-starter-kit-for-fire-tv.Displaying an App Developed in a 720p EnvironmentThe resolution for Fire TV apps is1080p (1920x1080). If your app was developed for a 720p interface, it fills only 2/3 of the display. In this case, the best solution is to alter your app to target 1080p. However, if you want to simulate a 720p environment, you can do so by putting the following meta tag in the header of your page. &lt;meta name=”viewport” content=”initial-scale=1.5, user-scalable=no”&gt;This meta tag sets a viewport, representing the area the web app page occupies, and sets a zoom level of 150%. The result is that the web app content looks like it would on a 720p display but fills the 1080p display area.For more information, see “Resolution and Page Scaling section” in Getting Started with Web Apps for Fire TV.",

      "fire-tv-web-app-faq-html": {
        "title": "Fire TV Web App FAQ",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The following are frequently asked questions about Fire TV Web Apps.  Q: How can I customize the Amazon Remote Back button behavior for a web app?  The Back button does not raise a standard key event. The default behavior for this button is to navigate back in the history stack until the WebView is at the root page, and once there a subsequent back press closes the application without informing the web app. As a workaround, you can use the History API to capture Back button presses by pushing to the history stack in the onLoad event.    Note that there is a bug in Chromium v25, which fires the onpopstate event on page load. This adds complexity to the following workarounds. For information about this bug, see the Chromium documentation for Issue 63040: Add window.history.state and don’t fire popstate after load.    There are two possible workarounds using the History API. Only one is needed. The following example is the preferred workaround. It uses the state to ensure that it acts on the correct popstate event.    window.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {    window.addEventListener(\"popstate\", function () {        if (window.history.state !== \"backhandler\") {            // put your back handler code here            window.history.pushState(\"backhandler\", null, null);        }    });    window.history.pushState(\"backhandler\", null, null);});        The second, non-preferred workaround sets a timeout to delay registering the onpopstate event until right after the load. This works, but relies on timers and therefore is not the primary recommendation.        window.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {    setTimeout(function() {        window.onpopstate = function(event) {            showConfirmDialog();            window.history.pushState(null, null, null);        };    }, 0);    window.history.pushState(null, null, null);});        Q: How do I properly close a web app?  Many apps need to explicitly close or end the application.  For example, they may override the Back button behavior to show a confirmation dialog prior to closing the app, and want to ensure the window is properly closed when selected by the user.  The snippet below provides a method of doing so.    window.open(\"\", \"_self\").close();        Q: Can web apps for Fire TV support digital rights management (DRM) for media playback?  No, the Web App Platform does not currently support any form of DRM for media playback.  For details about DRM support for native FireTV applications, see the DRM section of the Specifications for Fire TV Devices page.  Q: Does my web app need to disable the screen saver during video playback?  Yes, your app should disable the screen saver on the Fire TV during video playback to allow for long running times without user interaction. When you submit your app, select the Prevent Sleep for Video Playback check box.    Otherwise, the screen saver appears after a period of inactivity, just as it would during navigation through the main menu.    Q: Can web apps for Fire TV use HTTP live streaming (HLS)?  Yes. HLS video playback is supported in the Web App Platform. However, be aware of the following known issues:          Videos do not pause automatically if put in background while loading or buffering. As a workaround, use the Page Visibility API to manually pause videos. For information on using the Page Visibility API to detect focus changes, see Getting Started with Web Apps for Fire TV.      Short video segments (~1-2 sec) may cause pauses and artifacts during playback.      Seeking in an HLS stream is not supported.      Getting the duration of an HLS video is not supported.      When the user performs a voice search during HLS playback the video is paused, and when the playback resumes, the video starts from the beginning.      An alternative to HLS that does not have these issues is VisualOn. Be aware though that VisualOn runs only if full-screen mode, and so you cannot use overlays or custom controls.        Q:  Can web apps for Fire TV use the Blob Interface API?  No. The Blob APIs are currently unsupported in the Web App Platform.  Note that the the Blob object is incorrectly present in the namespace which may cause some feature detection libraries to wrongly identify the platform as being Blob-capable.  Q: Why does my web app show an unchanging duration of 1:40 seconds during audio and video playback?  For both audio and video elements, the duration property incorrectly reports a time of 100 seconds (1:40) during the initialization period.  If you set your text field at this time and do not update it, it will improperly show 1:40.  The correct value is in fact made available once the media element has begun playback.  The following code example shows a workaround of using the durationchange event to update the element with the correct duration during initialization.    video.addEventListener(\"durationchange\", function() {    // when this event fires, the media duration should be available    document.getElementById(\"duration\").innerHTML = video.duration;});        Q: How do I allow users to control video playback using the remote?  Some HTML5 elements cannot be focused with the remote. For example, div and span elements cannot be focused with the remote. Also, if you rely on default video controls, the individual Play, Pause, Forward, and Rewind buttons cannot be focused. However, the video element as a whole can be focused and can be controlled with the remote keys.  Q: Can I launch the virtual keyboard and tell when text has been submitted?  The virtual keyboard appears when the user presses the Select button on an text input field. This keyboard can be used by either the Amazon Remote or the Amazon Game Controller. Currently, there is no way to launch the virtual keyboard programmatically (for example, by setting focus).    If you want to know when the user has submitted text, you can listen for the change event, as demonstrated in the following code. Note that this event does not fire if the user clicks the Back button rather than the Submit button.    &lt;input id=\"test\" value=\"\"&gt;var testInput = document.getElementById(\"test\");testInput.addEventListener(\"change\", function(e){    console.log(this.value);});        Q: Why does my app show unexpected behavior with third-party authentication pages?  If you redirect to third-party authentication page within the same WebView, rather than using window.open() to create a new WebView, the authentication page replaces the original login page in history. This can cause an issue in scenarios with multiple login options (for example, Google or Facebook). The problem is that users cannot go back if they change their mind about logging in. The authentication page that replaced the app will typically just close.    The following actions cause such navigation problems:          Redirecting the window location -&gt; window.location.href = \"google_authentication_link\"      Using the window.location.replace() function        Instead, use the window.open() function.     Note: Using window.location.assign() does not work in the current WebView.    Q: Can my web app support MOV Files?  No, currently Amazon WebView has no support for MOV files.  Q: Can I use CSS viewport units?  You can use the vw/vh/vmin/vmax units except in conjunction with the CSS translate() function. In the current release of AWV (v25), you cannot translate an absolutely positioned element using CSS viewport units. This is a known issue in v25 of Chromium. See Issue 137617: vh, vw units don’t work in css transforms in the Chromium documentation. As a workaround, you can use the following calculation in v25 to get the equivalent viewport unit value in pixels for the unsupported CSS properties.    1vw = ( window.innerWidth/100 )1vh = ( window.innerHeight/100 )M vw = ( window.innerWidth/100 ) * MN vh = ( window.innerHeight/100 ) * N        Q: How can I simulate a 720p environment for my web app?  To simulate a 720p environment, put the following meta tag in the header of your web app page.  Please note that the viewport meta tag is technically unsupported for initial release and scales pages up on 1080p displays (potentially causing page distortion). This makes the following snippet more of a workaround than a solution.    &lt;meta name=”viewport” content=”initial-scale=1.5, user-scalable=no”&gt;        This meta tag sets a viewport, representing the area the web app page occupies, and sets a zoom level of 150%. The result is that the web app content looks like it would on a 720p display.    For more information, see the “Resolution and Page Scaling” section on Getting Started with Web Apps for Fire TV.    Q: Can I use VisualOn for media playback?  You cannot force Fire TV or Fire TV Stick to use VisualOn for media playback. The platform automatically chooses the best player to handle the video type.     Note: The amazon_enhanced_hls video attribute flag was introduced on 1.4.1 (Fire TV) and 1.0.1 (Fire TV stick) for applications to route HLS playback to the VisualOn player. The downside of this attribute was that playback would take place in full-screen with built-in controls and the web developer did not have an option to override the controls.    As of Fire TV 1.5 and Fire TV Stick 1.1, these platforms no longer support the amazon_enhanced_hls attribute because the platform automatically chooses the best player (native or VisualOn) depending on the video type. Pages that were authored to have the amazon_enhanced_hls attribute will continue to load on a suitable player; however, video playback will not automatically go to full screen. The page must request to go full screen in JavaScript as needed.    Q: How can I improve scaling performance?  When a video element gets focus, its size is often scaled up by setting the CSS property “height” and “width”. This practice causes full background repaint during navigation. Use -webkit-transform: scale() instead for image resizing to avoid unnecessary repaints. For example, the following CSS code causes unnecessary repaints:    .focused .video-element-thumb {    width: 288px;    height: 162px;    //...}        The following CSS code avoids unnecessary repaints:    .focused .video-element-thumb {    -webkit-transform: scale(1.125, 1.125);    //...}        Q: Is Web Audio supported in web apps for Fire TV  Yes. Starting with  Fire TV 1.5 and Fire TV Stick 1.1, Fire TV supports Web Audio. For more information, See Getting Started with Web Apps for Fire TV.  Q: If I use the img tag for buttons, do I have to include alt text?  Yes. Applications using img tag as buttons (with onClick handlers) must have the “alt” attribute to have those buttons read out in accessibility mode. Otherwise, the buttons are not accessible to users in accessibility mode.  Q: Are Known Media Source Extensions (MSE) supported in web apps for Fire TV  No. MSE support is disabled in Web Apps for Fire TV (though not for other platforms). Because MPEG-DASH is built on MSE, MPEG-DASH is not supported as well. Without the adaptive streaming support offered by MSE, it is possible that the end user devices might take longer to recover from network congestion and that seeks may take longer. Note, however, that Web Apps on Fire TV platform does support the other adaptive streaming standard, HLS.",

This library initializes any Amazon plugins and raises an amazonPlatformReady event to to signal that the APIs are ready for use. The library is hosted at the URL http://resources.amazonwebapps.com/v1/latest/Amazon-Web-App-API.min.js. To include this library, add the following &lt;script&gt; tag to your web app:&lt;script src=\"https://resources.amazonwebapps.com/v1/latest/Amazon-Web-App-API.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Note: Including the Amazon API JavaScript library is necessary only if your app uses Amazon APIs.Because this library raises an amazonPlatformReady event when initialization is complete, wait for the amazonPlatformReady event before you call any Amazon APIs, as in the following example:document.addEventListener('amazonPlatformReady', function () {    //API code goes here});Using Web App Tester and DevToolsWeb App Tester is a tool that lets you test your hosted and packed apps on the Fire TV device.Web App Tester also enables using DevTools to debug your web app. For information on getting and using DevTools, see Debugging Your Web App.To enable DevTools on Fire TV:  In the Web App Tester tool, launch your web app.  On the Amazon Fire TV remote, press the Menu button.  Select the Enable Devtools menu item and follow the instructions in the dialog box that appears.Resolution and Page ScalingTarget a resolution of 1080p (1920x1080) for web apps for Fire TV. For information on scaling up your app from 720p to 1080p, see Customizing Your Fire TV Web App. For more information about design guidelines for Fire TV web apps, see Design and User Experience Guidelines. Web Audio API SupportFire TV and Fire TV Stick both support the Web Audio Api for web apps. They also support the suspend and resume methods of the AudioContext interface. These methods allow applications to pause the audio device when needed. Suspending audio playback reduces CPU usage and prolongs battery life. The following example illustrates creating an AudioContext object and calling the suspend and resume methods. // Create contextvar context = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();// Start contextvar oscillator = context.createOscillator(); oscillator.connect(context.destination); oscillator[oscillator.start ? 'start' : 'noteOn'](0);// Suspendcontext.suspend();// Resumecontext.resume();// Since both suspend and resume return a promise, their success/failure can be determinedcontext.suspend().then( function() { alert('success!'; }, function() { alert('failure!'; });context.resume().then( function() { alert('success!'; }, function() { alert('failure!'; });Coupled with the page visibility API, suspend and resume provides an ideal way to silence games and other applications that use Web Audio when they go into the background and when the user initiate a voice search. For more information and code examples, see the following Focus Changes and Voice Search Interruption sections. Focus ChangesA web app may need to track when it is moved to the background (as when the user presses the Home button) so that the app can preserve its state at the moment when it is moved to the background and can resume when it is brought to the foreground. The following table shows the different methods and their behavior.            Method      Description                  Custom Amazon events: pause and resume      pause event is fired when the app is sent to the background (app completely hidden) or when its partially obscured (for example, when the Voice Search dialog box is displayed)resume event is fired when the app is brought to the foreground (app completely visible) including when the Voice Search dialog box is dismissed.               Page Visibility API       webkitvisibilitychange event is fired:  • when the app is sent to the background (completely hidden)  • when the app is brought to the foreground (completely visible)       Custom Amazon EventsTo use the custom Amazon events, you need to include the Amazon Webapp API script in your app and have your app listen for pause and resume events fired on the document.  To register as a listener for the pause event, use the following syntax.document.addEventListener(“pause\", yourCallbackFunction, false);The pause event is fired when the app is sent to the background (app completely hidden) or when it’s partially obscured (e.x Voice Search Dialog is displayed). The app should use document.addEventListener to attach an event listener once the amazonPlatformReady event fires.To register as a listener for the resume event, use the following syntax.document.addEventListener(“resume\", yourCallbackFunction, false);The resume event is fired when the app is brought to the foreground (app completely visible) including when the Voice Search Dialog is dismissed.  The app should use document.addEventListener to attach an event listener once the amazonPlatformReady event fires.The following code snippet illustrates registering for the pause and resume events.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Page Visibility Test Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Visibility : &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=\"appstate\"&gt; Visible &lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://resources.amazonwebapps.com/v1/latest/Amazon-Web-App-API.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;    var visibility =  document.getElementById(\"appstate\");    function onPause() {        visibility.innerHTML = 'Hidden';    }    function onResume() {        visibility.innerHTML = 'Visible';    }    function onAmazonPlatformReady() {        document.addEventListener(\"pause\" , onPause, false);        document.addEventListener(\"resume\" , onResume, false);    }    document.addEventListener(\"amazonPlatformReady\" , onAmazonPlatformReady, false);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;The Page Visibility APIFor all types of apps, the web app platform fires a visibility changed event, using the Page Visibility API, when the app loses or gains focus. (For more information on detecting loss of focus, see the FAQ Web Apps for Fire TV.)For video-playback apps, the video is paused automatically when the app loses focus. However, you must ensure that your UI is in the proper state when the app regains focus. For example, it is a good idea to bring up the media controls so the user can see the state of the playback, and to ensure the app responds to Play/Pause button. Alternatively, you may want to resume the video automatically.However, for audio apps, the app itself must pause the audio playback. This is especially important because presses on the media buttons are not passed to an app when it is in the background, so the user has no way to pause audio playback. The following code shows how to detect changes in focus. Note that these events use the “webkit” prefix. var handleVisibilityChange = function() {    if (document.hidden || document.webkitHidden) {        // pause audio/video playback, pause game, adjust video control UI, etc.    } else {        // resume playback, adjust UI, etc.    }}document.addEventListener('webkitvisibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);If you are using Web Audio, you can use the Page Visibility API to detect changes in focus and use the suspend and resume methods of the AudioContext object to pause and resume audio playback, as illustrated in the following example. (For more information on Web Audio, see the preceding Web Audio Support section.)// Create contextvar context = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();// Start contextvar oscillator = context.createOscillator(); oscillator.connect(context.destination); oscillator[oscillator.start ? 'start' : 'noteOn'](0);// Determine the correct visibility api names.var hidden, visibilityChange;if (typeof document.hidden !== \"undefined\") { // Opera 12.10 and Firefox 18 and later support        hidden = \"hidden\";        visibilityChange = \"visibilitychange\"; }else if (typeof document.webkitHidden !== \"undefined\") {        hidden = \"webkitHidden\";        visibilityChange = \"webkitvisibilitychange\"; }// Page visibility listener.function handleVisibilityChange() {   if (document[hidden]) {     if (context.suspend) {       context.suspend();     } else {       // Browser does not support suspend()     }   } else {     if (context.resume) {        context.resume();     } else {          // Browser does not support resume()     }   }}document.addEventListener(visibilityChange, handleVisibilityChange, false);Voice Search InterruptionA requirement for applications submitted for Fire TV is that they stop or pause audio playback when the user presses the Voice Search button on the remote.  This is to ensure that the microphone on the remote does not pick up audio from the system and perform poorly. Your app can detect when the user presses the Voice Search button in two ways:  By responding to the custom Amazon pause and resume events  By using the Page Visibility API, as explained in the previous section (for platform version 1.3 only)For more information and codes examples, see the preceding Focus Changes section.For video-based media applications, the web app platform will automatically handle pausing the video. You only need to ensure that your UI is in the proper state when your app regains focus. For example, ensure that the Play/Pause button is correctly set, or you may decide to bring up the video control overlay.For games, you must also ensure that audio playback is muted or paused. A common solution in this situation is to put the game in a paused state.Audio-only apps must also stop or pause playback. When you use Web Audio, you can use the suspend and resume methods of the AudioContext object to properly handle voice search requests when using WebAudio.  (For more information on Web Audio, see the preceding Web Audio Support section.)&lt;script src=\"https://resources.amazonwebapps.com/v1/latest/Amazon-Web-App-API.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var context = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();function onPause() {    context.suspend();}function onResume() {    context.resume();}function onAmazonPlatformReady() {    document.addEventListener(\"pause\" , onPause, false);    document.addEventListener(\"resume\" , onResume, false); }document.addEventListener(\"amazonPlatformReady\" , onAmazonPlatformReady, false);&lt;/script&gt;Testing IAPIf you use the IAP API 1.0 in your web app (IAP 2.0 does not currently support web apps), you can test IAP by using the SDK tester. For more information on testing IAP see Testing In-App Purchasing.To use SDK Tester:   Download the Amazon Web App SDK from Amazon Apps and Games Services SDKs.  Install the SDK tester apk in App-SDk.zip/Android/In-App-Purchasing/1.0/tools/AmazonSDKTester.apk.      Create a JSON file with the following contents. (This example was developed for the YouZeek music-streaming app.)     {    \"vip_unlimited\" : {        \"itemType\" : \"ENTITLED\",        \"price\" : 0.99,        \"title\": \"VIP Subscription Parent\",        \"description\": \"VIP Subscription Parent\",        \"smallIconUrl\": \"Any Image Link Here\"    },    \"vip_unlimited_monthly\" : {        \"itemType\" : \"SUBSCRIPTION\",        \"price\" : 0.99,        \"title\": \"VIP Monthly Subscription\",        \"description\": \"VIP Monthly Subscription\",        \"smallIconUrl\": \"Any Image Here\",        \"subscriptionParent\": \"vip_unlimited\"    }}            Run the following command:    adb push amazon.sdktester.json /mnt/sdcard/amazon.sdktester.json        or copy the JSON file into the root folder of the device as amazon.sdktester.json.     Launch web app using the Web App Tester.Features Not Available on Fire TVThe following web application platform features are not available on Fire TV:  Geolocation (GPS)  Popup windows  Multiline text boxes  Launching an app to an external browser  Uploading files    Downloading files WebGL is supported on Fire TV, but not supported on the Fire TV stick.",
