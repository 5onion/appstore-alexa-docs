        "content": "After you have successfully built the app, spend some time exploring the various screens. The following sections show what each screen in the the sample app in Fire App Builder.  Screens in the app  Activities Performed with Each Screen  Explore Fire App Builder’s Contents  Subfolder Contents  Configurable JSON Files Overview  Next StepsScreens in the appSplash screen. This screen appears when you first launch the app and displays only until the app finishes loading (usually less than a second). Note: You can completely customize this screen and any other screen that shows the “Fire App Builder” text. For example, in place of “Fire App Builder” you can substitute your own company name or design.After the app loads, you see the Home screen.Home screen with the ContentBrowseActivity. This view arranges the videos in various categories or groups. When you view a channel, the first video in that channel group appears as the featured background image, with its title and description in the upper-left. This is the default layout.With the Home screen, you have a couple of display options, depending on the activity you select. By default, the Home screen has the ContentBrowseActivity activity configured. However, you can also load a more compact view by associating this screen with the FullContentBrowseActivity activity instead:Home with FullContentBrowseActivity. With this activity, all the videos appear in a more compressed grid, with the categories listed on the left. None of the videos are superimposed as large featured images in the background.When you select a video, the video is highlighted with the background image appearing in the upper-right:Home screen with video selected. The selected video appears with the large image in the background.When you click the video again, the Content Details screen appears with play buttons:Content Details. This screen shows the details for a specific video, including both the title and description.If the video description extends beyond the display width available, a modal appears to allow users to see the additional description content.Content Details screen. If the description doesn't fit within the alotted space on the Content Details screen, users can expand it to read more.When you play media, the Renderer screen appears.Renderer. This screen appears when you play media.When the controls display on the video, Recommended Content appears below the controls below a dim overlay. If you click the down arrow on your remote, the recommended content shifts into prominent view without the dim overlay.Recommended Content selected and displayedIf you’ve already played the media, a different set of controls appears below the video when you view the content details.Resuming playback on the Details. If you stopped watching a video part-way through, instead of a WATCH NOW button, you see RESUME PLAYBACK and WATCH FROM BEGINNING buttons.To search for a video, select the search button on the home screen. When you do, the Search screen appears and allows you to type a keyword. The search will match the keyword against the title and description elements.Search. This screen allows users to search for media.The search results screen lists the results as media cards in a grid:Search. The search results appear as thumbnails below the search bar. Here the word bay matches a number of different videos.Activities Performed with Each ScreenActivities are the various functions the app can do. Each activity invokes a different screen. Fire App Builder has six available activities:  ContentBrowseActivity  ContentDetailsActivity  ContentSearchActivity  FullContentBrowseActivity  SplashActivity  VerticalContentGridActivity(Both ContentBrowseActivity and FullContentBrowseActivity can be used for the Home screen.)Each activity in Fire App Builder uses a different screen. The screen used by each activity is configured through the Navigator.json file (located in app &gt; assets). The graph object (shown below) from Navigator.json contains key-value pairs that associate the activity with the screen and other properties:\"graph\": {    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.SplashActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_SPLASH_SCREEN\"    },    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.FullContentBrowseActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_HOME_SCREEN\"    },    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.ContentDetailsActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_DETAILS_SCREEN\"    },    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.ContentSearchActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_SEARCH_SCREEN\"    },    \"com.amazon.android.uamp.ui.PlaybackActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_RENDERER_SCREEN\"    }  }For example, the SplashActivity displays the Splash screen. The ContentBrowseActivity displays the Home screen, and so on.You can associate any activity with any screen, but the only activity that makes sense to switch up is the ContentBrowseActivity. You can replace this activity with FullContentBrowseActivity to provide the more compact Home screen layout described earlier.The other properties for each activity in this code are as follows:            Activity property      Description                  verifyScreenAccess      Require the user to authenticate to view the screen. Set this to true if you want to require users to log in prior to viewing content. Mostly you would verify screen access for the Content Renderer screen only, so that users can get a sense of the media first and feel more enticement to log in.              verifyNetworkConnection      Require a network connection to show the screen. (If the page contains only settings and no online media, you could set this to false. But for most screens, leave this at true. )              onAction      The action to perform (such as display a certain screen) when the activity runs.      The AndroidManifest.xml file initiates the SplashActivity activity when the app starts:&lt;activity    android:name=\"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.SplashActivity\"    android:screenOrientation=\"landscape\"&gt;    &lt;intent-filter&gt;        &lt;action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" /&gt;        &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" /&gt;        &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LEANBACK_LAUNCHER\" /&gt;    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;&lt;/activity&gt;This SplashActivity activity loads the Splash screen.Beyond these activities and screens, you can also write your own activity and associate it with your own screen. (Details on how to make this advanced customization are beyond the scope of this documentation.)Explore Fire App Builder’s ContentsBefore you start creating your app, take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the various libraries, modules, and components available in Fire App Builder.The available components in Fire App BuilderThe following table briefly describes each component.            Folders      Description                  AMZNMediaPlayerComponent      Used to play streaming media.              AdsInterface      An interface for ads.              AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent      Component that implements the Purchase Interface for Amazon In-app purchasing.              AnalyticsInterface      An interface for analytics.              AuthInterface      An interface for authorization.              ContentBrowser      Controller (from the Model-view-controller architectural pattern) that allows users to browse content within the app. It fetches the feed and controls flows, recipes, and configurations.              ContentModel      Model (from the Model-view-controller architectural pattern) that defines the method for storing data that the browser will use to render.              DataLoader      Reusable module to load data from the network. Commonly used for loading the feed.              DynamicParser      Configurable module to parse the feed and populate the model.              FacebookAuthComponent      Component that implements the Auth Interface for Facebook authorization.              FlurryAnalyticsComponent      Component that implements the Analytics interface for Flurry analytics.              ModuleInterface      The core code that makes different components modular in the Fire App Builder framework.              PassThroughAdsComponent      Dummy implementation for the ads interface, used by Fire App Builder. If you don’t have an ad implementation in your app, you can use this as base code to start your own ads module.              PurchaseInterface      An interface for setting up payments.              TVUIComponent      Contains the TV UI code, which is based on the Leanback Support Library. Also contains the classes for the activities.              UAMP      Universal Android Media Player. Amazon Media Player builds on top of UAMP to extend it with additional features.              Utils      Contains reusable Java classes, including security classes used to encrypt and decrypt keys used with some components (such as Facebook Authorization, Adobe Pass, and Flurry Analytics components).              Application      A sample app that uses the various libraries and components in the Fire App Builder framework. This is the app that you customize (see Download Fire App Builder and Build an App).       Note: When you open Fire App Builder in Android Studio, the “Android” view shows this folder as “app” because it’s your working app. If you switch over to the “Project” view, you’ll see that the app folder is actually named “Application.”Subfolder ContentsWithin each folder in Fire App Builder, you usually see the same pattern of subfolders. The following table describes each subfolder:            Subfolder      Contents                  build      This subfolder, required by Android, is auto-generated when the project builds. Do not edit files in the build folder.              libs      If this subfolder is included, it contains external libraries required by a component or other external service. Do not edit files in this folder. Other times the libraries required by a component are referenced as dependencies in the build.gradle file and retrieved when the project builds.              src      Contains the actual code for the component or function. The res subfolder contains resources for the component, which you will frequently work with if using the component. When you edit files, you will primarily edit files that appear within the res subfolder.              test      Unit test files. The content in test folders mirrors the content in the main folder but is meant for writing unit tests. Unit tests don’t require any Android dependencies — you can run them on your own machine without a Fire TV device. You usually don’t need to do anything in this folder.              androidTest      Tests that require an Android dependency. These tests require a Fire TV device to run the code. You usually don’t need to do anything in this folder.      Configurable JSON Files OverviewThe basic app in Fire App Builder requires almost no Java coding. Instead, you configure the app through various JSON files that contain simple key-value pairs that allow you to specify the app options you want. The following are the JSON files you can configure.            JSON or XML files to configure      Location                  Navigator.json      app &gt; assets              BasicFileBasedUrlGeneratorConfig.json      app &gt; assets &gt; configurations              BasicHttpBasedDownloaderConfig.json      app &gt; assets &gt; configurations              DataLoadManagerConfig.json      app &gt; assets &gt; configurations              LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json      app &gt; assets &gt; recipes              LightCastContentsRecipe.json      app &gt; assets &gt; recipes              LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json      app &gt; assets &gt; recipes              LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json      app &gt; assets &gt; recipes              custom.xml      app &gt; res &gt; values      (Don’t worry about configuring the JSON or XML files now. The files are listed here simply to introduce you to upcoming the configuration tasks. The point is that you can configure your app by merely adjusting JSON or XML files instead of doing Java programming.)Next StepsNow that you have a good feel for the basic functionality, libraries, and components in Fire App Builder, it’s time to start customizing it with your own content.

      "fire-app-builder-connecting-adb-to-fire-tv-html": {
        "title": "Connect to Fire TV Through ADB",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "You can use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to connect your development computer to an Amazon Fire TV device or stick for installing, testing, and debugging your apps.Before you use ADB to connect to Fire TV or Fire TV stick, complete the following sections: Note: Android Debug Bridge is provided by the Android Open Source Project, not by Amazon.  Step 1. Enable Debugging on Amazon Fire TV  Step 2. Set Up Android Debug Bridge          Mac OS X      Windows        Step 3. Add Android Debug Bridge to Your Path          Mac OS X      Windows        Step 4: Options for Connecting ADB          Connect ADB Through the Network      Connect ADB Through USB        Update ADB  Run Your App  Troubleshooting  Using an Android TV Emulator  Next StepsStep 1. Enable Debugging on Amazon Fire TVYou must enable both ADB and debugging on your Fire TV device before you can connect to it:  From the main screen of your Fire TV, select Settings.  Select Device &gt; Developer Options.  Turn on ADB Debugging.      (Optional) If you plan to connect your computer to your Fire TV device using a USB cable, turn on USB Debugging.     Note: When USB Debugging is enabled, the USB port is unavailable for other uses such as external storage or input devices. To re-enable the USB port, turn off USB debugging.    Turn on Apps from Unknown Sources.Step 2. Set Up Android Debug BridgeAndroid Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line utility for running and managing Android apps on your device or emulator. ADB is available when you install Android Studio, but Windows users will need to install a special USB driver.Mac OS XNo action is required for ADB to work on Mac OS X.WindowsIf you’re on Windows and want to connect your computer to Fire TV through a USB cable, you need to install a special USB driver to connect your computer to a Fire TV device through ADB. The driver supports all the Fire TV platforms. To install the driver:  Download the USB file and extract the zip file’s contents.  Double-click the FireDevices_Drivers.  Complete the installation dialog boxes as prompted. Note: The USB driver is only certified through Windows 8.1. If you’re on Windows 10, you will need to explicitly accept that you are installing from an “un-certified source.”Step 3. Add Android Debug Bridge to Your PathYou need to add ADB to your PATH so you can more easily execute adb commands. (Your PATH is an environment variable used to specify the location of the program’s executable. If you don’t add ADB to your PATH, running adb commands will require you to browse to the &lt;Android SDK&gt;/platform-tools directory to run adb.)Mac OS XTo add ADB to your PATH on Mac:      Get the path to your Android SDK platform-tools directory:                  Open Android Studio and click the SDK Manager button .        The location to your Android SDK appears near the top next to Android SDK Location. For example: /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk        If this is your first time opening Android Studio, there isn’t an SDK Manager button. Instead, at the Welcome to Android Studio prompt, click Configure &gt; SDK Manager and provide the location to the Android SDK.            Copy the path to the SDK and paste it somewhere convenient, such as a text editor.      Add /platform-tools to the end of the path you copied in the previous step. (“platform-tools” is the directory containing the adb executable.)      Copy the full path to your clipboard.            Use the following command to add adb to your .bash_profile, replacing /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/ with your path to your Android SDK.    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile        Your .bash_profile file is usually in your user directory, which you can find by typing cd ~ (change to your user directory). Then type ls -a (list all) to show all files, including hidden ones.    If the file isn’t there, simply create one. You can then type open .bash_profile to see the paths listed. One of the lines should be something like this: export PATH=$PATH:/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/.        Restart any terminal sessions, and then type adb. If you successfully added ADB to your path, you will see ADB help info rather than “command not found.”  WindowsTo add ADB to your PATH on Windows:      Get the path to your Android SDK platform-tools directory:                  Open Android Studio and click the SDK Manager button .        The location to your Android SDK appears near the top next to Android SDK Location. For example: C:\\Users\\&lt;your user name&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools        If this is your first time opening Android Studio, there isn’t an SDK Manager button. Instead, at the Welcome to Android Studio prompt, click Configure &gt; SDK Manager and provide the location to the Android SDK.            Copy the path to the SDK and paste it somewhere convenient, such as a text editor.      Add /platform-tools to the end of the path you copied in the previous step. (“platform-tools” is the directory containing the adb executable.)      Copy the full path to your clipboard.        Click Start and type view advanced system settings in the search box.  Click View advanced system settings.  When the System Settings dialog opens, click the Environment Variables button.  Under System Variables (the lower pane), select Path and click Edit.      Do one of the following:          On Windows 7 or 8, move your cursor to the farthest position on the right, type ; and then press Ctrl+V to insert the path to your SDK that you copied earlier. It may look like this: ;C:\\Users\\&lt;your user name&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools. Click OK on each of the three open dialog boxes to close them.      On Windows 10, click the New button and add this location.        Restart any terminal sessions, and then type adb. If you successfully added ADB to your path, you will see ADB help info rather than “command not found.”Step 4: Options for Connecting ADBYou can use ADB to connect the Fire TV or Fire TV stick to your computer in two ways:  Connect ADB Through the Network. With this option, you connect using either a wired Ethernet or WiFi network connection. Both your computer and the Fire TV device must be on the same network for a network ADB connection to work.  Connect ADB Through USB. With this option, you use an A-to-A USB cable to establish a direct USB connection. Note: The following instructions apply to Generation 2 devices that have a more updated user interface. If you have a generation 1 device, the menu locations differ slightly.Connect ADB Through the NetworkYou need the IP address of your Fire TV device on your network to connect ADB to it.  If you haven’t already done so, connect your Fire TV device to a network (the same network that your computer is on). To do this, from the Fire TV home screen, go to Settings &gt; Network and select a network.  From the Fire TV home screen, select Settings.      Go to Device &gt; About &gt; Network. Make a note of the IP address listed on this screen.     Tip: Copy this IP address onto a convenient and visible place if you plan to connect regularly via the network.        Open a terminal window.    On a Mac, you can open Terminal by pressing Cmd + spacebar and then typing Terminal. On Windows, you open the Command Prompt usually by typing cmd in your program search. (The exact steps vary based on your Windows version.)    Make sure your Fire TV device and your computer are on the same network. You can use either a wifi network or a wired network.      Run the following commands, where &lt;ipaddress&gt; is the IP address of the Fire TV device noted in the previous section:    adb kill-serveradb start-serveradb connect &lt;ipaddress&gt;         Note: Make sure you added ADB to your PATH, as described in Add Android Debug Bridge to Your Path. Otherwise you will need to cd (change directories) to the platform-tools directory first and use./adb on a Mac or adb on Windows to run adb commands.    If the connection was successful, ADB responds with the message:    connected to &lt;ipaddress&gt;:5555            Verify that the Fire TV device appears in the list of devices:    adb devices        ADB responds with the message:    List of devices attached&lt;ipaddress&gt;:5555  device      If the serial number does not appear after running adb devices, update ADB and then repeat the steps here. Tip: You don’t always need to kill and start the server with ADB. Usually you can just run the adb connect &lt;ipaddress&gt; command.Connect ADB Through USBTo connect your computer to Fire TV through USB, you need an A-to-A USB cable. Note that you must have a Fire TV, not a Fire TV Stick, because only Fire TV (the box) has the USB cable port.  If you’re on Windows, install the USB driver as described in Set Up Android Debug Bridge.  Connect your Fire TV to a USB port on your computer.      Run the following commands:    adb kill-serveradb start-serveradb devices      After the last command, ADB responds with the following message, where &lt;serialno&gt; is the serial number of the device:List of devices attached&lt;serialno&gt; deviceIf the serial number does not appear after running adb devices, update ADB and then repeat the steps here.After ADB connects your computer to your Fire TV device, when you open Android Studio and click the Run App button, you’ll be prompted with a dialog box like this:In this example, “Amazon AFTS” refers to Fire TV (Generation 2).Update ADBIf your device isn’t listed when you type adb devices, try updating ADB:      Open a terminal session and navigate to your Android SDK tools directory.    In Android Studio, you can see the installation directory by going to Tools &gt; Android &gt; SDK Manager or by clicking the SDK Manager button . The directory is listed next to Android SDK Location.        In your Terminal or Command Prompt, change directories (cd) to your Android SDK directory, and then cd one level down to tools. (The tools directory is contained within the SDK directory.)        Run one of the following commands to update ADB:    Mac:    ./android update adb        Windows:    android update adb        You receive a message that says ADB has been updated.  Run Your AppAfter you have connected your computer to your Fire TV device through ADB, you can build and run your app on the Fire TV device. In Android Studio, click the Run App button .TroubleshootingIf you receive a message such as the following: unable to connect to 192.168.0.6:5555: Operation timed outorerror: device offlinetry any of the doing the following:  Make sure both Fire TV and your computer are using the same network and router.  When connecting wireless with adb connect &lt;ipaddress&gt;, make sure you’re typing the IP address correctly, with all the required dots .  Close Android Studio and any other emulators or USB cable connections.  Kill (adb kill-server) and restart (adb start-server) the server.  Restart Fire TV (Settings &gt; Device [or System] &gt; Restart).  Restart your router.  Update ADB.  Search online for the error message you’re seeing.Using an Android TV EmulatorIf you absolutely cannot use a Fire TV device to test your app, there is limited support for using an emulator. See Use an Android TV Emulator to Run Your App.Next StepsWith ADB all set up, you’re ready to download and build Fire App Builder.",

        "content": "To build the sample app with Fire App Builder, complete the instructions in the following sections:  1. Clone the Fire App Builder Project  2. Set Up the JDK  3. Install Android Studio and the Necessary Tools and SDKs  4. Open the Sample App  5. Customize the Fire App Builder Sample Project  Next Steps1. Clone the Fire App Builder ProjectFire App Builder is available in a Github repository (https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder) that you can download or clone. Cloning a repo allows you to get updates from the repository when they become available.To clone the repo:  Get git, if you don’t already have it.      If you use Windows, configure git to allow symbolic links (symlinks):    git config –global core.symlinks true         Note: On Windows, if you clone the repo without git’s symbolic linking configured to true, Fire App Builder won’t build.    Go to https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder.  Click Clone or Download, and then copy the clone URL: https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder.git  Open your command line and browse to a convenient directory for the project.      Clone the project:    git clone https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder.git        git is initialized in a directory called fire-app-builder and the Fire App Builder project is downloaded.     Tip: If you want to clone the repo into an existing (empty) folder, first browse to the folder on the command line and then run git clone https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder.git . to copy the repo into the existing folder. Or git clone https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder.git myspecialfolder to download the project into a folder called myspecialfolder.  2. Set Up the JDKYou need the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle to compile Java apps on your machine.First check to see if you already have the JDK. Open Terminal or Command Prompt and type java -version. If you have the JDK, the response should be something like this:java version \"1.8.0_101\"Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)On Windows you can also manually look in a directory such as C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0\\ to see if the JDK is there.If you don’t have the JDK, download the appropriate version of the JDK Installer for your machine from Java SE Development Kit Downloads and run it.For more details, see the following:  Mac: 10 JDK 8 Installation for OS X  Windows: JDK Installation for Microsoft Windows. (Specifically, see “Running the JDK Installer” and “Updating the PATH Environment Variable.”)  For other operating systems and information, see JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Start Here.3. Install Android Studio and the Necessary Tools and SDKsTo work with Fire App Builder, you need to install Android Studio, the official IDE for Android projects.See Getting Started with Android Studio and Install Android Studio for information about setting up the Android Studio development environment on your machine.The Fire App Builder project requires you to have certain SDK tools and APIs installed with Android Studio. Selecting these tools from the Standalone SDK Manager ahead of time isn’t necessary. When you open the Fire App Builder project (as described in the next section, Open the Sample App), Android Studio will prompt you to install any build tools or APIs that you’re missing. For example, you might see messages such as the following:Or you may see the following in the Gradle Console:Click these links to install the missing tools and rebuild the project. Simply keep opening the project and installing any missing tools as prompted until Android Studio no longer complains.You can also open the Standalone SDK Manager and install all the tool and SDK requirements ahead of time. To install the necessary tools:  Go to Tools &gt; Android &gt; SDK Manager (or simply click the SDK Manager button ).  On the SDK Tools tab, exand Android SDK Build-Tools and select the following:          24.0.1      24.0.3      25.0.0      25.0.2        Expand LLDB and select the following:          Android Emulator      Android SDK Platform-Tools      Android SDK Tools        Expand Support Repository and select the following:          Android Support Repository      Google Repository      After selecting the check boxes, click the Apply button.4. Open the Sample App Warning: Allow about 30-40 minutes for Android Studio to download and build the app the first time.In this step, you will open the “Application” project from Fire App Builder in Android Studio and build the app:  Start Android Studio.      At the Welcome screen, click Open an existing Android Studio project.        Note that if you don’t see this welcome screen, you most likely have not configured Android Studio with the JDK or any Android SDKs.        Inside the Fire App Builder project folder, select the Application folder, and then click OK.        Depending on the latest release of Gradle, you may be prompted to update Gradle. If prompted, click Don’t remind me again for this project.    Gradle starts importing and building the project.     Note:  The first time you open the project, it can take anywhere from 20-40 minutes for Gradle to build the project, depending on the assets Gradle needs to download as well as your network and processor speed. Subsequent times should take about a minute or less. While you’re waiting, consider taking an app tour to become familiar with the app, and also consider exploring the Settings options on your Fire TV device.        Open the Gradle Console by clicking Gradle Console in the lower-right corner so you can monitor the progress of the Gradle Build. This will let you know if the build succeeds or if Android Studio requires other downloads. Wait until Gradle finishes building.    If Android Studio highlights any missing libraries or SDKs, follow the prompts to download and fix the issues.    When finished, you should see a message in the Gradle Console that says BUILD SUCCESSFUL. When Gradle finishes building the project, Android Studio will show the following directories in the Android view:        When Android opens the project, by default the Android view is shown (circled in red in the previous screenshot), and the “Application” folder is simply referred to as “app.” The Android view flattens the project’s files and displays the most commonly used files into a more usable arrangement, but the actual structure of the files differs on your computer disk. (The “Project” view will show you the actual arrangement of all the folders and files.)     Note: Unless otherwise specified, this documentation refers to locations of files using the Android view.    Connect your computer to your Fire TV device following the instructions in Connecting to Fire TV Through ADB.  Click the Run ‘app’ button .      In the Select Deployment Target dialog box, select Amazon, and then click OK.        In the Select Deployment Target dialog box, AFTS refers to Amazon Fire TV (Generation 2). If you have the stick, it will say AFTT (Generation 2) or AFTM (Generation 1).     Tip: If you don’t see the Amazon option, you haven’t connected your computer to the Fire TV device through ADB. If you don’t have a Fire TV, there is limited support for using an emulator.    When the app builds successfully, your Fire TV device will load the application. See Take an App Tour provides a screen-by-screen walkthrough of the app.    If you run into build failure, you can try cleaning and rebuilding the project (Build &gt; Clean Project or Build &gt; Rebuild Project).    If you close the app on your Fire TV, you can relaunch it using the Fire TV UI by going to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage Installed Applications &gt; Fire App Builder with your remote control.    Note that ADB builds the app on your connected device in a temporary folder. When you disconnect your device, the app will no longer be available on the Fire TV. If you want to permanently install the app onto your Fire TV, you will need to sideload the app onto your device. See Installing and Running Your App.  5. Customize the Fire App Builder Sample ProjectThe first step in creating your app is to customize the “Application” folder. The Application folder contains the sample app created with Fire App Builder. You have two options for customizing the Application folder. The option you choose depends on how you want to handle later updates that you might pull from the Github repo:  Option 1: Duplicate the Application folder and its files: When you run git pull to get later updates from the Fire App Builder repo, you won’t have to resolve any merge conflicts for potential updates to Application’s files. However, if there are updates to the Application folder and its contents, you won’t be prompted to merge them into your project. Additionally, if code in other folders requires updates to the Application folder, your project may break without these updates.  Option 2: Directly customize the Application folder and its files: When you run git pull to get later updates from the Fire App Builder repo, you will be prompted with merge conflicts that you’ll have to sort through. It will be more tedious to get the updates, and you’ll need to be familiar with how to resolve merge conflicts with git repos. However, you will be sure not to miss any updates to the Application folder and its files.To customize the Application folder:  In Android Studio, close the Fire App Builder project by going to File &gt; Close Project.  Using Finder (Mac) or your File Explorer (Windows), browse to the directory where you downloaded Fire App Builder. Do one of the following:          Duplicate the Application folder (option 1). Then rename the copy (for example, “Gizmoapp”).      Directly rename the Application folder (option 2) (for example, “Gizmoapp”).        Inside your customized Application folder (“Gizmoapp”), delete the build folder (which stores the generated app).  In Android Studio, from the Welcome screen that is displayed, click Open an existing Android Studio project. Select your customized Application folder (“Gizmoapp”) within the Fire App Builder folder, and click OK.  If prompted about upgrading Gradle plugin settings, click Don’t remind me again for this project.  Expand the Project pane (but not the Project view) in the upper-left corner to view the files.  In the app folder, expand res &gt; values and open the strings.xml files.      In the app_name string, type the name of your app.    Note that the AndroidManifest.xml file (inside app &gt; manifests) reads the name of the application from the string you just edited. (In Android Manifest, the code referencing the string is android:label=\"@string/app_name\". This is how most of Fire App Builder is set up — code that you customize is extracted out into XML files so you don’t have to directly edit Java.)        Open your app’s AndroidManifest.xml file (located in app &gt; manifests) and update the com.amazon.android.calypso package name to a package name that reflects your app’s new name. For example, if your app was named “Gizmoapp,” you might change it to the following:    &lt;manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"    package=\"com.amazon.android.gizmoapp\"&gt;        The sample app in Fire App Builder doesn’t have any classes in the com.amazon.android.calypso package, but you can add custom classes to overwrite existing Fire App Builder functionality or add to it.    Go to Build &gt; Clean Project to clean up any artifacts from the previous app. (This process takes several minutes.)  Build your new app by clicking the Run ‘app’ button .Next StepsNow that you’ve built and customized the default app in Fire App Builder, see Take an App Tour to get more familiar with what Fire App Builder offers.",

        "title": "Configure Navigator -- Open Feeds",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "If your feed is openly accessible (that is, no tokens are required), follow the steps in the section below. In contrast, if your feed requires tokens, see Configure Navigator – Token-based Feeds instead. For an overview to configuring Navigator, see Navigator Configuration Overview.  Configure Navigator.json for Non-token-based Feeds  Handling Live Media  Hard-Coding Your Categories  Next StepsConfigure Navigator.json for Non-token-based FeedsUse this approach for feeds that don’t require tokens to access the media.  Open the Navigator.json file (located in app &gt; assets).      Look for the globalRecipes object:    \"globalRecipes\": [    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    },    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    }]            Make the number of categories and contents objects match the number of media URLs in your URL file. For example, if you have 4 media URLs, you would need four sets of these categories and contents objects and a different DataLoaderRecipe for each.    In this scenario, your URL file (which you configured in Load Your Media Feed) might look like this:    {  \"urls\": [    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=263&amp;app_key=4rghy65dcsqa&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=249&amp;app_key=gtn89uj3dsw&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=267&amp;app_key=6tgbfr4edc2x&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=273&amp;app_key=u8jnsaq2rfgy&amp;action=channels_videos\"  ]}        As a result, your globalRecipes object in Navigator.json would look as follows:    \"globalRecipes\": [    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    },    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    },    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    },    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    }]         Note: Although the sample app in Fire App Builder has 4 media URLs in the URL file, you see only two DataLoaderRecipe files. This is because only 2 of the 4 media URLs are actually used — there are more than enough videos already.        If you haven’t already done so, increment the number in the DataLoaderRecipe files for each line of media in your URL file. If you have 4 media URLs, you would increment the DataLoaderRecipe by one each time (LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json, LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json, LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json, and LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json).     Note: Optionally, you can rename the files to a name that more closely reflects your app, or you can leave them as LightCast.        As needed, create the additional DataLoaderRecipe files by duplicating the LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json file and incrementing the index number for each file:    LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json would look like this:    {  \"task\": \"load_data\",  \"url_generator\": {    \"url_index\": \"0\"  }}        LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json would look like this:    {  \"task\": \"load_data\",  \"url_generator\": {    \"url_index\": \"1\"  }}        LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json would look like this:    {  \"task\": \"load_data\",  \"url_generator\": {    \"url_index\": \"2\"  }}        LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json would look like this:    {  \"task\": \"load_data\",  \"url_generator\": {    \"url_index\": \"3\"  }}        Each of these DataLoaderRecipe files will load the data from each line of your URL file (urlFile.json):    {  \"urls\": [    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=263&amp;app_key=4rghy65dcsqa&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=249&amp;app_key=gtn89uj3dsw&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=267&amp;app_key=6tgbfr4edc2x&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=273&amp;app_key=u8jnsaq2rfgy&amp;action=channels_videos\"  ]}       Note: The file construction is rather manual here, but here’s what’s happening. Fire App Builder will first query for the categories, and then the contents. Fire App Builder can only get one URL at a time, so if your media feed consists of multiple URLs stored in the urlFile.json file (as is the case with the Fire App Builder sample app), you’ll need to repeat the categories and contents objects for each URL.Handling Live MediaIf you have live media, you can adjust the app so that just one button appears on the Content Details screen: Watch Now. (This is because with live content, you can’t rewind and “Watch from Beginning.”)If you want to mark your entire feed as live, open Navigator.json (located in your app &gt; assets folder), and add the following property shown in red.

Instead of loading your categories from the LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json file, you configure the categories inside the globalRecipes object like this:\"globalRecipes\": [{  \"categories\" : {    \"name\" : \"Hard-coded category name\"  },  \"contents\" : {    \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/YourAppNameDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",    \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/YourAppNameContentsRecipe.json\"  } }]Just load the contents recipe, not the categories recipe (since you don’t have categories in your feed). The contents object is loaded in the same way described in the previous section, with a separate DataLoaderRecipe[#] file for each media URL in the URL file.Next StepsNow that your feed is configured, it’s time to start customizing the look and feel of your app. See Customize the Look and Feel of Your App.",

For an overview in configuring Navigator, see Navigator Configuration Overview.  Configure Navigator.json for Token-based Feeds  Handling Live Media  Hard-Coding Your Categories  Next StepsConfigure Navigator.json for Token-based FeedsUse these instructions if you have media feeds that are token-based. In this step, you will configure Navigator.json with the category and content recipe files you created earlier.      Open the Navigator.json file (located in app &gt; assets) and look for the globalRecipes object:    \"globalRecipes\": [    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    },    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    }]            Duplicate the categories and contents pairs for as many media feeds as you have. In this example, there are two media feeds, so there are two sets of categories and contents objects. Suppose you have 4 media feeds. Then your globalRecipes object would look like this:    \"globalRecipes\": [    {      \"categories\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"      },      \"contents\" : {        \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"      }    },     {       \"categories\" : {         \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",         \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"       },       \"contents\" : {         \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json\",         \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"       }     },     {       \"categories\" : {         \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json\",         \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"       },       \"contents\" : {         \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json\",         \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"       }     },     {       \"categories\" : {         \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json\",         \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json\"       },       \"contents\" : {         \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json\",         \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/LightCastContentsRecipe.json\"       }     }]        Remember to separate items in the array with commas.        If you haven’t already done so, update the LightCastDataLoaderRecipe file names to increment each time (LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json, LightCastDataLoaderRecipe2.json, LightCastDataLoaderRecipe3.json, LightCastDataLoaderRecipe4.json) for each CategoriesRecipe and ContentsRecipe instance. This is because the DataLoaderRecipe can only load one URL at a time, so if you have 4 URLs in your URL file, you need 4 DataLoaderRecipe files to load all the feeds.     Note: Optionally, you can rename the files to a name that more closely reflects your app, or you can leave them as LightCast.        Open each of your LightCastDataLoaderRecipe.json files and replace the contents with the following:    {  \"task\" : \"cache_data\",  \"data_file_path\" : \"/\",  \"url_generator\" : {      \"base_url\" : \"http://yourcompany.com/mediafeed?id=$$token$$\",      \"token_generation_url\" : \"http://yourcompany.com/url_to_generate_token\"  }}            In each of your DataLoaderRecipe files, configure the base_url and token_generation_url with the same values you used in BasicTokenBasedUrlGeneratorConfig.json (inside assets &gt; configurations). However, for each LightCastDataLoaderRecipe, load a different media feed URL, so that each base_url value is unique.  Handling Live MediaIf you have live media, you can adjust the app so that just one button appears on the Content Details screen: Watch Now. (This is because with live content, you can’t rewind and “Watch from Beginning.”)If you want to mark your entire feed as live, open Navigator.json (located in your app &gt; assets folder), and add the following property shown in red. Some content before and after the object is shown to provide context.     ...{      \"categories\": {        \"name\": \"Hardcoded Category Name\"      },      \"contents\": {        \"dataLoader\": \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\": \"recipes/LightCastAllContentsRecipe.json\"      },      \"recipeConfig\": {        \"liveContent\": true      }    }  ],  \"graph\": {    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.SplashActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_SPLASH_SCREEN\"    },    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.ContentBrowseActivity\": {    ...If you have only some media that is live, and it’s mixed in with other content that isn’t live, you can match this content in the matchList parameter when you query for your contents.

Instead of loading your categories from the LightCastCategoriesRecipe.json file, you configure the categories inside the globalRecipes object like this:\"globalRecipes\": [{  \"categories\" : {    \"name\" : \"Hard-coded category name\"  },  \"contents\" : {    \"dataLoader\" : \"recipes/YourAppNameDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",    \"dynamicParser\" : \"recipes/YourAppNameContentsRecipe.json\"  } }]Just load the contents recipe, not the categories recipe (since you don’t have categories in your feed). The contents object is loaded in the same way described in the previous section, with a separate DataLoaderRecipe[#] file for each media URL in the URL file.Next StepsNow that your feed is configured, it’s time to start customizing the look and feel of your app. See Customize the Look and Feel of Your App.",

To do this, you will configure the globalRecipes object in the Navigator.json file with the categories and contents recipes you customized earlier.  DataLoaderRecipe  Two Kinds of FeedsDataLoaderRecipeThe DataLoaderRecipe file loads a media feed URL. Because DataLoaderRecipe can load only one media feed URL at a time, if you have multiple media feed URLs, you will have to create multiple DataLoaderRecipe files, each time referencing the same category and contents recipes. This can be somewhat manual to set this up, but once set up, you won’t need to touch it again.Two Kinds of FeedsThe approaches for configuring Navigator differ for token or non-token-based feeds.

        "title": "Load Your Media Feed",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The heart of your app is the media feed. This feed contains your video content, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and other details for each media object. (Note: Your app must have a media feed to use Fire App Builder.)Since different media feeds have different structures (with different terms for the various properties or elements), Fire App Builder queries your media feed for the needed components and converts the queried result to a structure and terminology that aligns with Fire App Builder’s content model. Before you write these queries (specifying them in categories and content recipes), you must first load your media feed following the instructions here.Two Fire App Builder components are used to load and configure the media feed: DataLoader and DynamicParser. The DataLoader module loads the data feed, and DynamicParser configures the structure and key values of the feed so that Fire App Builder can read it. Rather than working in Java, you configure both of these modules through JSON files. The Java code will read from the values in various JSON files.  Types of Feeds          Load Token-based Feeds      Load Open Feeds        Other Options for Loading the Feed  Live Feeds  Loading a Static Feed That Is Packaged with Your App  Next StepsTypes of FeedsYou can load the following types of feeds:  Token-based Feeds  Open FeedsLoad Token-based FeedsUse these instructions if you publish your media details in a web feed whose access is restricted by a token.      Open the DataLoadManagerConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations).     Tip: In Android Studio, instead of browsing folders, you can press Shift key twice and then type the file name to quickly find a file.    Leave the value for the data_downloader.impl option as is: com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicHttpBasedDataDownloader.  If desired, update the options for these two properties:          is_cache_manager_enabled: Whether your feed is cached in the app. Caching your feeds speeds up screen loading with the media retrieved, but the cache will not reflect the latest updates to the feed until the data loader is updated or until the feed is expired. Options are true or false. Usually leave this as true.      data_updater.duration: The interval (in seconds) when the data loader refreshes your feed and retrieves the latest updates. When the data loader updates, the cache gets purged. The default is 2000 seconds, or 5.5 hours.         Note: Each time users start the app, your app’s cache is automatically purged and the feed is refreshed.        Open the BasicHttpBasedDownloaderConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations) and change the value from com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicFileBasedUrlGenerator to com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicTokenBasedUrlGenerator:    {  \"url_generator_impl\": \"com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicTokenBasedUrlGenerator\"}            Create a file inside app &gt; assets &gt; configurations called BasicTokenBasedUrlGeneratorConfig.json. Inside the file, create a JSON object that includes two key-value pairs as follows:    {  \"base_url\" : \"http://yourcompany.com/mediafeed?id=$$token$$\",  \"token_generation_url\" : \"http://yourcompany.com/url_to_generate_token\"}            Customize the values for both base_url and token_generation_url with your company’s actual values.    The base_url is the URL to your media feed. The token_generation_url contains a link to a URL that generates the token to access the URL.    In this example, the token is inserted into the URL with $$token$$. (Your media URL may insert the token in some other way. If so, adjust the placement of the $$token$$ where it should appear.)    The parameters from this BasicTokenBasedUrlGeneratorConfig.json file (base_url and token_generation_url) get passed to the BasicTokenBasedUrlGenerator class (located in DataLoader &gt; java &gt; com.amazon.dataloader). The BasicTokenBasedUrlGenerator class constructs a URL which is then consumed by the BasicHttpBasedDataDownloader class. The BasicHttpBasedDataDownloader class gets and retrieves the content from the URL.  Load Open FeedsUse these instructions if you publish your media details in a web feed that is open and unrestricted, that is, no token is required to access the media.      Open the DataLoadManagerConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations).     Tip: In Android Studio, instead of browsing folders, you can press Shift key twice and then type the file name to quickly find a file.        Ensure the value for the data_downloader.impl option is com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicHttpBasedDataDownloader:    {  \"data_downloader.impl\": \"com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicFileBasedDownloaderConfig\",  \"is_cache_manager_enabled\": true,  \"data_updater.duration\": 14400}            Open the BasicHttpBasedDownloaderConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations) and ensure the value for url_generator_impl is com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicFileBasedUrlGenerator:    {  \"url_generator_impl\" : \"com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicFileBasedUrlGenerator\"}            Open the BasicFileBasedUrlGeneratorConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations) and verify the contents matches the code below. This file specifies the location of the url_file that will contain your media feed. To make things easiest, leave the file name as the default:    {  \"url_file\" : \"urlFile.json\"}            Open the urlFile.json (located in app &gt; assets) and list your media feed URLs.    {  \"urls\": [    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=263&amp;app_key=4rghy65dcsqa&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=249&amp;app_key=gtn89uj3dsw&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=267&amp;app_key=6tgbfr4edc2x&amp;action=channels_videos\",    \"http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=273&amp;app_key=u8jnsaq2rfgy&amp;action=channels_videos\"  ]}      Other Options for Loading the FeedIf neither of these options work for you to load your feed, you can write your own data loader by adding a class in the DataLoader folder that implements the Dataloader interface. Additionally, if your feed is generated from a REST endpoint, you will have to write your own data downloader.Live FeedsIf you have a live TV feed, there’s nothing special you need to do to load it. You can load it the same way as your other media. However, when you configure options in Navigator.json, you can add a parameter that tells Fire App Builder to  remove the “Watch from Beginning” button for live streams. You can also identify live media through tags when the content recipe. See Navigator Configuration Overview for more details.Loading a Static Feed That Is Packaged with Your AppFor testing purposes, you may want to load a static feed that is packaged within your app. You wouldn’t normally do this, since you wouldn’t be able to update the feed without resubmitting a new version of your app. Hence this would be done for testing purposes only.To load a static feed that is packaged inside your app:  Open the DataLoadManagerConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations).  Change the value for data_downloader.impl to com.amazon.dataloader.datadownloader.BasicFileBasedDownloaderConfig.  Open the BasicFileBasedDownloaderConfig.json file (located in app &gt; assets &gt; configurations).      If desired, you can rename the XML file:    {  \"data_file_path\": \"GenericMediaData.xml\"}        Place your feed file into the app &gt; assets folder.Next StepsLoading the feed is just the first step.

Leave it at the default value: DynamicParser.                      format                      Specifies the data format for the incoming data feed. Options are json or xml.                      translator                      Specifies whether translation or reflection is used when converting your feed’s objects to the Fire App Builder content model. Translation is faster and recommended. To use translation, simply leave the value at the default: ContentContainerTranslator. If you want to use reflection instead, remove the translator parameter altogether from the recipe. Also see the “How do I use reflection…” question in the FAQ, because using reflection will require a change in the names used in the matchlist parameter.                      model                      Specifies the content model for the data. The content model provides the structure for your content and maps it into the Fire App Builder UI. Leave it at the default: com.amazon.android.model.content.ContentContainer.                      modelType                      Specifies whether the feed is an array or a single object. Available options are array or single. Almost all feeds are array. For example, if your JSON feed is enclosed within square brackets, or your XML feed has nested angle brackets, choose array. If your feed is structured as a single object, choose single.                          query                      A query used to return categories from your media feed. The syntax of the query depends on the structure of your feed. You will need to construct the right query to get your categories. For JSON feeds, use Jayway JsonPath syntax for the query syntax. For XML feeds, use XPath expressions for the query syntax. See query Parameter below for more details.                          queryResultType                      If the result from the query (a specified in the query parameter) returns a list of strings, include this queryResultType parameter and set it equal to []$. If the query’s result is an object (a map), omit this parameter. (Fire App Builder needs to know the result type because it will needs to push an object into a Java hashmap.)                          matchList                      The query that you defined in the query parameter returns a result. This result needs to be mapped from your feed’s names to the names Fire App Builder uses in its content model. The matchList parameter maps the results from the query to the name for media categories in Fire App Builder. See matchList Parameter for more details.                      keyDataType                       The media objects that are related to the category. It’s essential to identify which media should be grouped into which category. Similar to matchList, you target the items on the left followed by @ and then keyDataPath to map and identify these media objects to the category. For example: StringKey@keyDataPath. See keyDataType Parameter for more details.            query ParameterThe syntax you use differs between JSON and XML. See the section that is relevant to your feed:  JSON Feeds  XML FeedsJSON FeedsThe sample app in Fire App Builder reads from a generic LightCast media feed that uses a JSON format. The Categories recipe uses the following value for the query parameter to return a list of categories from your feed: $..categories[*]. This is Jayway JsonPath syntax. Here’s what this syntax means:            Query Syntax      What It Matches                  $      Specifies the root directory as the beginning of the search.              ..      Indicates a recursive search in every directory and subdirectory of the root for matches.              categories[]      Says to look for the named array called “categories”.              *      Matches any contents (wildcard).      Putting it all together: $..categories[*] Starts at the root ($), looks in every directory and subdirectory recursively for matches (..), and looks to match on a named array called categories, with any contents in the array (*).You can test your queries using the Jayway JsonPath Evaluator.With the sample app in Fire App Builder, if you run this query ($..categories[*]) against one of the LightCast feed URLs, the result returns the category names as strings, like this:[   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"Jamaican History\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Wildlife\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Wildlife\",   \"The Country Jamaica\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"Jamaican Wildlife\",   \"Jamaican Attractions\",   \"Jamaican Wildlife\"](Fire App Builder will remove duplicates from the query result.)Fire App Builder needs to take the array of objects and convert the array to a hashmap to process in a Java class. So the next parameter (queryResultType) is used to convert the array of strings into an array of objects.\"queryResultType\": \"[]$\",See Querying JSON for more details about constructing Jayway JsonPath queries. See also Jayway JsonPath for more details about Jayway JsonPath in general.XML FeedsIf your feed is XML, instead of using Jayway JsonPath, you must use XPath expressions to target the specific elements in your feed. XPath reduces your XML document into various items called “nodes.” The XPath syntax targets the location of specific nodes.Suppose your XML feed contains a structure like this:&lt;rss&gt;    &lt;channel&gt;        &lt;item&gt;        &lt;title&gt;Sample Title&lt;/title&gt;        &lt;pubDate&gt;Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:34:22 PDT&lt;/pubDate&gt;        &lt;link&gt;https://example.com/myshow/episodes/110&lt;/link&gt;        &lt;author&gt;Sample Author name&lt;/author&gt;        &lt;category&gt;Technology&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;category&gt;Gadgets&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;/item&gt;    &lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;Here’s a sample XPath expression to get the categories in this XML feed://category/text()The // looks recursively in all nodes for matches, no matter where those nodes are located in the hierarchy. category selects the category node, and text() selects the text from that node.You can test this out using the XPath Tester/Evaluator. The response from the expression is as follows:Text='Technology'Text='Gadgets'(You can ignore the Text= part. This is just part of the XPath Tester/Evaluator’s display, not what was matched in the query.)Note that with iTunes feeds, there’s a general category for the feed (such as &lt;itunes:category text=\"Technology\"&gt;) as well as categories for each item (&lt;category&gt;Technology&lt;/category&gt;). When you target categories for your recipe, you want to target the categories for each item in the feed, not the general feed categories.Try copying your XML feed into the XPath Tester/Evaluator and selecting the categories using a similar syntax.See Querying XML for more examples showing XPath expressions. See also XPath syntax and the examples section on XPath Examples for more details about XPath expressions in general. Note: If individual items in your feed are associated with multiple categories, your app’s display will show those items in each category they’re associated with. For example, if your Cool Video appears in both Technology and Gadgets categories, this video will appear in two places in your app’s display.matchList ParameterThe purpose of the matchList parameter is to select specific properties from the category query result and map them to the Fire App Builder content model.The syntax used by matchList is not Jayway JsonPath or XPath expressions but rather custom Fire App Builder syntax that targets specific elements in the query result. (Hence the JSON and XML instructions are combined in the same sections.)In the sample app in Fire App Builder, the value for the Categories recipe is StringKey@name.Here’s how this syntax works. On the left of the ampersand (@) you put the property you want to target in the query result (StringKey selects the list of strings). On the right of the ampersand (@), you put the Fire App Builder element you want to map the property to (name).For the Categories recipe, your matchList parameter should map your feed’s categories to name.In the Fire App Builder sample app, since the query result is a list of strings, StringKey is used to match the strings. But suppose the result set from your query contained a JSON object such as the following:\"list\": { \"title\" : \"My category title\" }To match on My category title and convert it to name, you would use the following:list/title@nameUse the forward slash (/) to go deeper in object levels (just like with with XPath). In this case, title is one object below list, which is one object below the root. After moving past these two levels, the result is simply the category name.To match XML elements, you follow a similar technique. Supposing the result is a list of strings:Text='Technology'Text='Gadgets'To match the text contents and map them to the category element in the Fire App Builder UI, you would use the following syntax:StringKey@nameIf your query result looked like this:&lt;list&gt;&lt;title&gt;My category title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Then you would map the category title like this:/list/title@nameThe forward slash (/) takes you one level deeper in the XML nodes.keyDataType ParameterFire App Builder needs to know which media items should be grouped with the selected categories. The keyDataType parameter identifies the media items that are related to a category. This parameter is used for the Category recipe and later passed into a variable in the Contents recipe.The Fire App Builder query result is a list of strings, so StringKey@keyDataPath is used to target the media items and associate them with the category. If your result is also a list of strings, then you would use the default:\"keyDataType\": \"StringKey@keyDataPath\"However, suppose your media objects were listed inside an assets node that in turn was nested inside a container node, like this:\"container\": {    \"assets\": [    \"5825652561001\",    \"5825652558001\",    \"5825652569001\",    \"5873045223001\",    ]}To get the media objects, you would write the query like this:container/assets@keyDataPathSimilar to the matchList parameter, the keyDataType query does not use Jayway JsonPath syntax either. Instead, you match each node by writing the node name followed by / to move into the next level. container/assets matches all the items at this level.On the right of the ampersand @, the keyDataPath key is how these media objects are stored and used by Fire App Builder. The @keyDataPath helps match up the items with the Fire App Builder content model.Feeds without CategoriesIf your feed lacks categories but you have separate feeds for each category, you can hard-code the category names when you configure Navigator.json. This will group all the videos in a particular feed with a particular category. More detail for this approach is provided in the “Hardcoding Your Categories.”Next StepsNow that you’ve configured the categories for your app’s media feed, you need to configure the contents.

Leave it at the default value: DynamicParser.                      format                      Specifies the data format for the incoming data feed. Options are json or xml.                      translator                      Specifies whether translation or reflection is used when converting your feed’s objects to the Fire App Builder content model. Translation is faster and recommended. To use translation, simply leave the value at the default: ContentTranslator. If you want to use reflection instead, remove the translator parameter altogether from the recipe. Also see the “How do I use reflection…” question in the FAQ, because using reflection will require a change in the names used in the matchlist parameter.                      model                      Specifies the content model for the data. The content model provides the structure for your content and maps it into the Fire App Builder UI. Leave it at the default: com.amazon.android.model.content.Content.                      modelType                      Specifies whether the feed is an array or a single object. Available options are array or single. Almost all feeds are array. For example, if your JSON feed is enclosed within square brackets, or your XML feed has nested angle brackets, choose array. If your feed is structured as a single object, choose single.                      query                      A query used to return content from your media feed. The syntax of the query depends on the structure of your feed. You will need to construct the right query to get your content. For JSON feeds, use Jayway JsonPath syntax for the query syntax. For XML feeds, use XPath expressions for the query syntax. See query Parameter below for more details.                      queryResultType                      If the result from the query (a specified in the query parameter) returns a list of strings, include this queryResultType parameter and set it equal to []$. If the query’s result is an object (a map), omit this parameter. (Fire App Builder needs to know the result type because it will needs to push an object into a Java hashmap.)                      matchList                      The query that you defined in the query parameter returns a result. This result needs to be mapped from your feed’s names to the names Fire App Builder uses in its content model. The matchList parameter maps the results from the query to the name for media categories in Fire App Builder. See matchList Parameter for more details.            query ParameterThe syntax for JSON feeds differs significantly from the syntax for XML feeds, so the two formats are treated separately in the following sections:  JSON Feeds  XML Feeds Tip: Although the query syntax in this section might seem a little complex, remember that Fire App Builder lets you use any feed structure you want, without limiting you to a specific order or specification (such as Media RSS). With this flexibility, it’s unavoidable that you’ll need to use more advanced query syntax to target the elements in your feed.JSON FeedsIn the sample app in Fire App Builder, the value for query is $[?(@.categories[0] in [$$par0$$])]. As with the query parameter in the Categories recipe, this is (mostly) Jayway JsonPath syntax. This syntax uses a Jayway JsonPath filter operator to select the items inside the categories array that have at least one item at the 0 position.Let’s take a step back to unpack this syntax with more clarity, because you’ll need to customize this query to fit your own feed syntax. A sample Lightcast feed (which is what the sample Fire App Builder uses) looks like this:[  {    \"id\": \"136211\",    \"title\": \"Legends Beach Resort, Negril Jamaica\",    \"description\": \"Legends Beach Resort, Negril Jamaica\",    \"duration\": \"538\",    \"thumbURL\": \"http:\\/\\/l3.cdn01.net\\/_thumbs\\/0000136\\/0136211\\/0136211__009f.jpg\",    \"imgURL\": \"http:\\/\\/l3.cdn01.net\\/_thumbs\\/0000136\\/0136211\\/0136211__009f.jpg\",    \"videoURL\": \"http:\\/\\/media.cdn01.net\\/802E1F\\/process\\/encoded\\/video_1880k\\/0000136\\/0136211\\/M3FA8J1MI.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13671\",    \"categories\": [      \"Jamaican Attractions\"    ],    \"channel_id\": \"13671\"  },  {    \"id\": \"136216\",    \"title\": \"Falmouth Jamaica Nature's Lullaby \",    \"description\": \"Falmouth Jamaica Nature's Lullaby\",    \"duration\": \"1813\",    \"thumbURL\": \"http:\\/\\/l4.cdn01.net\\/_thumbs\\/0000136\\/0136216\\/0136216__001f.jpg\",    \"imgURL\": \"http:\\/\\/l4.cdn01.net\\/_thumbs\\/0000136\\/0136216\\/0136216__001f.jpg\",    \"videoURL\": \"http:\\/\\/media.cdn01.net\\/802E1F\\/process\\/encoded\\/video_1880k\\/0000136\\/0136216\\/L2XGJI1LM.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13672\",    \"categories\": [      \"The Country Jamaica\"    ],    \"channel_id\": \"13672\"  },  {    \"id\": \"136209\",    \"title\": \"Rafting on the Rio Grande River, Jamaica\",    \"description\": \"Rafting on the Rio Grande River, Jamaica\",    \"duration\": \"660\",    \"thumbURL\": \"http:\\/\\/l1.cdn01.net\\/_thumbs\\/0000136\\/0136209\\/0136209__010f.jpg\",    \"imgURL\": \"http:\\/\\/l1.cdn01.net\\/_thumbs\\/0000136\\/0136209\\/0136209__010f.jpg\",    \"videoURL\": \"http:\\/\\/media.cdn01.net\\/802E1F\\/process\\/encoded\\/video_1880k\\/0000136\\/0136209\\/I9BDFF0IM.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13671\",    \"categories\": [      \"Jamaican Attractions\"    ],    \"channel_id\": \"13671\"  }](This isn’t the full feed, but it shows the repeating structure.)Plug this feed into the Jayway JsonPath Evaluator. Then run the following query:$[?(@.categories in [\"The Country Jamaica\"]\")]This query returns the following:[   {      \"id\" : \"136216\",      \"title\" : \"Falmouth Jamaica Nature's Lullaby \",      \"description\" : \"Falmouth Jamaica Nature's Lullaby\",      \"duration\" : \"1813\",      \"thumbURL\" : \"http://l4.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136216/0136216__001f.jpg\",      \"imgURL\" : \"http://l4.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136216/0136216__001f.jpg\",      \"videoURL\" : \"http://media.cdn01.net/802E1F/process/encoded/video_1880k/0000136/0136216/L2XGJI1LM.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13672\",      \"categories\" : [         \"The Country Jamaica\"      ],      \"channel_id\" : \"13672\"   }]Here’s what this query syntax retrieves:            Query Syntax      What It Matches                  $[      Starts at the root and selects the unnamed array.              ?(@.categories[0] in [\"The Country Jamaica\"]      Creates a filter for all categories arrays that contain [\"The Country Jamaica\"] in the 0 index position.      Now there’s one difference in query syntax used in the sample Fire App Builder app. Instead of [\"The Country Jamaica\"], the query parameter uses $$par0$$ instead:\"query\": \"$[?(@.categories[0] in [$$par0$$])]\"$$par0$$ is a variable defined in Fire App Builder that stores all the items retrieved by the query, and this is where the syntax differs from Jayway JsonPath. In the code, the keyDataType from the categories recipe actually populates the $par0$$ variable with categories.Let’s go through one more example. Suppose your JSON looks like this:{    \"titles\": {        \"video\": [            {                \"category\": \"reference\",                \"publisher\": \"Jess\",                \"title\": \"Video title 1\",                \"price\": 3.95            },            {                \"category\": \"history\",                \"publisher\": \"John\",                \"title\": \"Video title 2\",                \"price\": 2.99            },            {                \"publisher\": \"Dave\",                \"title\": \"Video title 3\",                \"price\": 8.99            },            {                \"category\": \"science\",                \"publisher\": \"Jess\",                \"title\": \"Video title 4\",                \"price\": 3.99            }        ]     }}To select all arrays containing science as category, you would use this query:$.titles.video[?(@.category contains \"science\")]This returns:[   {      \"category\" : \"science\",      \"publisher\" : \"Jess\",      \"title\" : \"Video title 4\",      \"price\" : 3.99   }]However, we need all items in the array that contain category, so we remove the conditions around the @.category:$.titles.video[?(@.category)]Now add the in [$$par0$$] variable:$.titles.video[?(@.category in [$$par0$$])]Here’s a summary:            Query Syntax      What It Matches                  $.titles.video[      Selects the title object and the video array.              ?(@.category in [$$par0$$]      Filters the array to match on all items that have category.      Note that when you add in [$$par0$$] in the Jayway JsonPath Evaluator, it will not understand this syntax because it’s specific to Fire App Builder rather than being part of Jayway JsonPath.Your query will look different based on your feed and the syntax necessary to match the content objects. For example, here’s a more complex query:$.assets[?(@.type == 'movie.Container' &amp;&amp; @.assetId in $$par0$$)]This query says to start at the root ($), look in the first directory level (.) to the object named assets, and filter the array to type objects that are equal to movie.Container and which contain an assetId element.XML FeedsIf your feed is XML, instead of using Jayway JsonPath you will use XPath expressions to target the specific elements in your feed. XPath reduces your XML document into various items called “nodes.” The XPath syntax allows you to target the location of specific nodes.Unlike with the Jayway JsonPath syntax, the syntax for XML feeds is much simpler.Suppose your feed looked like this:&lt;rss&gt;    &lt;channel&gt;        &lt;item&gt;        &lt;title&gt;Sample Title 1&lt;/title&gt;        &lt;pubDate&gt;Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:34:22 PDT&lt;/pubDate&gt;        &lt;link&gt;https://example.com/myshow/episodes/110&lt;/link&gt;        &lt;author&gt;Sample Author name&lt;/author&gt;        &lt;category&gt;Gadgets&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;/item&gt;        &lt;item&gt;        &lt;title&gt;Sample Title 2&lt;/title&gt;        &lt;pubDate&gt;Mon, 24 Oct 2016 09:24:12 PDT&lt;/pubDate&gt;        &lt;link&gt;https://example.com/myshow/episodes/109&lt;/link&gt;        &lt;author&gt;Sample Author name&lt;/author&gt;        &lt;category&gt;Technology&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;/item&gt;    &lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;The query for your content would look like this://itemIn XPath, the //item will match any instances of the item element regardless of its position in the XML structure. (There’s no need for the [$$par0$$] with the XML.)See Querying XML for more details about constructing XPath queries.matchList ParameterThe matchList parameter selects specific properties in the query’s result and maps the properties to Fire App Builder’s content model. The syntax used by matchList is custom Fire App Builder syntax that targets specific elements.In the sample app in Fire App Builder, the value for the Contents recipe is an array of property mappings that maps the title, id, description, media, and images to Fire App Builder’s content model. This is what the matchlist parameter looks like in the sample app:[    \"title@title\",    \"id@id\",    \"description@description\",    \"videoURL@url\",    \"imgURL@cardImageUrl\",    \"imgURL@backgroundImageUrl\"  ]Here’s how this syntax works. On the left of the ampersand (@) you put the property you want to target in the query result (for example, title). On the right of the ampersand (@), you put the Fire App Builder element you want to map the property to (for example, title).The following table lists the Fire App Builder elements that you can map properties or elements of your feed to:Fire App Builder NameDescriptionRequired        title              Video title.              Required              id              Video ID (string). Used to uniquely identify the media object.              Required              subtitle              Subtitle for a video.              Optional              description              Description of the video.              Required              url              Link to the video.              Required              cardImageUrl              Image thumbnail that appears on the home screen alongside other media thumbnails. The ideal size is 548px by 452px. See the following section on Image Resolutions for more detail.              Required              backgroundImageUrl              Larger image that appears when media is selected. The ideal size is 1920px x 1080px. See the following section on Image Resolutions for more detail.              Required              tags              Used to associate recommended content. See Recommend Content Through Tags for more information.              Optional              live              Used to identify live stream content. For live stream content, the “Watch from Beginning” button is not shown when users return to the media after having previously watching it. See Configure Live Streams for more information.              Optional       Warning: The Fire App Builder content model requires you (at the very least) to map your feed’s elements to the title, ID, description, URL, card image, and background image. If you have just one image, you can map both the card and background image to the same image.To better understand how the matchlist parameter works, let’s step through the details in the Fire App Builder sample app. In the LightCast media feed for Fire App Builder, the selections from the query parameter returns the following:[   {      \"id\" : \"136211\",      \"title\" : \"Legends Beach Resort, Negril Jamaica\",      \"description\" : \"Legends Beach Resort, Negril Jamaica\",      \"duration\" : \"538\",      \"thumbURL\" : \"http://l3.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136211/0136211__009f.jpg\",      \"imgURL\" : \"http://l3.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136211/0136211__009f.jpg\",      \"videoURL\" : \"http://media.cdn01.net/802E1F/process/encoded/video_1880k/0000136/0136211/M3FA8J1MI.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13671\",      \"categories\" : [         \"Jamaican Attractions\"      ],      \"channel_id\" : \"13671\"   },   {      \"id\" : \"136216\",      \"title\" : \"Falmouth Jamaica Nature's Lullaby \",      \"description\" : \"Falmouth Jamaica Nature's Lullaby\",      \"duration\" : \"1813\",      \"thumbURL\" : \"http://l4.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136216/0136216__001f.jpg\",      \"imgURL\" : \"http://l4.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136216/0136216__001f.jpg\",      \"videoURL\" : \"http://media.cdn01.net/802E1F/process/encoded/video_1880k/0000136/0136216/L2XGJI1LM.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13672\",      \"categories\" : [         \"The Country Jamaica\"      ],      \"channel_id\" : \"13672\"   },   {      \"id\" : \"136209\",      \"title\" : \"Rafting on the Rio Grande River, Jamaica\",      \"description\" : \"Rafting on the Rio Grande River, Jamaica\",      \"duration\" : \"660\",      \"thumbURL\" : \"http://l1.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136209/0136209__010f.jpg\",      \"imgURL\" : \"http://l1.cdn01.net/_thumbs/0000136/0136209/0136209__010f.jpg\",      \"videoURL\" : \"http://media.cdn01.net/802E1F/process/encoded/video_1880k/0000136/0136209/I9BDFF0IM.mp4?source=firetv&amp;channel_id=13671\",      \"categories\" : [         \"Jamaican Attractions\"      ],      \"channel_id\" : \"13671\"   }]The matchList parameter converts these property names in the feed to the names used in Fire App Builder’s content model:[    \"title@title\",    \"id@id\",    \"description@description\",    \"videoURL@url\",    \"imgURL@cardImageUrl\",    \"imgURL@backgroundImageUrl\"  ]  title@title converts title to title  id@id converts id to id  description@description converts description to description  videoURL@url converts videoURL to url  imgURL@cardImageUrl converts imgURL to cardImageUrl  imgURL@backgroundImageUrl converts imgURL to backgroundImageUrl(In this example, a lot of the names are the same, but in your feed, might might have terms such as videoTitle, videoSummary, and so on.)Customize the left side of the ampersand @ to correspond with your own feed’s terminology; customize the right side of the @ to correspond with Fire App Builder’s term in its content model.Your feed might not list each element in a simple key-value pair. If you have various levels of nesting, your matchList might look like this:    \"common/title@title\",    \"assetId@id\",    \"common/subtitle@subtitle\",    \"common/description@description\",    \"video/videoURL@url\",    \"imgURLs/ImageSmall@cardImageUrl\",    \"imgURLs/ImageLarge@backgroundImageUrl\"With this syntax, the forward slash (/) separates elements at each level. For example, common/title looks inside the common object to match on the title property.Let’s look an an example using XML. Suppose your XML feed looks like this:&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;&lt;rss version=\"2.0\" … …&gt;  &lt;channel&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Content Mix for US News-in-Pictures 9x16&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;description&gt;Screenfeed Content Server&lt;/description&gt;    &lt;lastBuildDate&gt;Mon, 08 Dec 2014 22:55:16 GMT&lt;/lastBuildDate&gt;&lt;ttl&gt;5&lt;/ttl&gt;    &lt;item&gt;      &lt;title&gt;John Anderson ……&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;guid isPermaLink=\"false\"&gt;1&lt;/guid&gt;      &lt;pubDate&gt;Mon, 08 Dec 2014 22:55:16 GMT&lt;/pubDate&gt;      &lt;category&gt;News&lt;/category&gt;      &lt;media:content url=\"http://samples.screenfeed.com/1.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\"&gt;        &lt;media:title type=\"plain\"&gt;1080x1920 - English - with caption&lt;/media:title&gt;        &lt;media:credit&gt;Â© 2014 News Agency&lt;/media:credit&gt;        &lt;media:thumbnail url=\"http://samples.screenfeed.com/public/us-news-in-pictures/1080x1920/h9xnRIN9CUGiTWNQBBrjOw-1080x1920h-1.jpg\" /&gt;      &lt;/media:content&gt;&lt;/item&gt;...  &lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;In order to get the contents, the query in the matchList parameter would look like this:  \"matchList\": [    \"title/#text@title\",    \"guid/#text@id\",    \"media:content/media:title/#text@description\",    \"media:content/#attributes/url@url\",    \"media:content/#attributes/url@cardImageUrl\",    \"media:content/#attributes/url@backgroundImageUrl\",  ]In this case, here’s how the conversions happen:  title/#text@mTitle converts title/#text to title  guid/#text@mId converts guid/#text to id.  media:content/media:title/#text@mDescription converts media:content/media:title/#text to description  media:content/#attributes/url@mUr converts media:content/#attributes/url to url  media:content/#attributes/url@mCardImageUrl converts media:content/#attributes/url to cardImageUrl  media:content/#attributes/url@mBackgroundImageUrl converts media:content/#attributes/url to backgroundImageUrl.The only real difference here is the use of the #text selector, which targets the text inside an element. The #text syntax is custom Fire App Builder syntax and is equivalent to text() in XPath.Here’s another example. Suppose your feed looks like this:&lt;rss&gt;    &lt;channel&gt;        &lt;item&gt;        &lt;title&gt;Sample Title 1&lt;/title&gt;        &lt;pubDate&gt;Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:34:22 PDT&lt;/pubDate&gt;        &lt;link&gt;https://example.com/myshow/episodes/110&lt;/link&gt;        &lt;author&gt;Sample Author name 1&lt;/author&gt;        &lt;category&gt;Technology&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;category&gt;Gadgets&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;/item&gt;        &lt;item&gt;        &lt;title&gt;Sample Title 2&lt;/title&gt;        &lt;pubDate&gt;Wed, 23 Oct 2016 08:33:12 PDT&lt;/pubDate&gt;        &lt;link&gt;https://example.com/myshow/episodes/109&lt;/link&gt;        &lt;author&gt;Sample Author name 2&lt;/author&gt;        &lt;category&gt;News&lt;/category&gt;        &lt;/item&gt;    &lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;Here’s what the matchlist parameter would look like:\"matchList\": [    \"title/#text@title\",    \"guid/#text@id\",    \"itunes:subtitle/#text@description\",    \"media:content/#attributes/url@url\",    \"media:content/media:thumbnail/#attributes/url@cardImageUrl\",    \"media:content/media:thumbnail/#attributes/url@backgroundImageUrl\"]Image ResolutionsYou can use two images for media in your app: an image card and a background image. The two types of images get used in different places, and the containers where each image is used also varies slightly.The following screenshot shows the difference between the two types of images on the Content Home screen:The image cards appear in a list of thumbnails. When you select one of the image cards, a larger background image appears in the upper-right area of the screen.The two images also appear on the Content Preview screen:Here the image card appears a little larger, with the background image filling the entire background of the screen. The background image has a dark gray overlay.The recommended image sizes (width x height) are as follows:  Image cards: 548px by 452px. This image can be larger but will be scaled down. The image will also be cropped to fill a 320px x 240px container in some cases.  Background images: 1920px x 1080px. This image can be larger but will be scaled down. The image will also be cropped to fill a 1120px x 800px container in some cases.When Fire App Builder does image cropping, it preserves the aspect ratio of the image by cropping the sides of the image (thus focusing on the center).Recommended Content (Through Tags)Below the video is a Recommended Content section that shows other videos with the same tags:To populate the Recommended Content section in the app, you need to match your tags in the matchList parameter. For example:common/tags@tagsHere the tags element appears inside a common element. This syntax converts common/tags to tags so Fire App Builder can read it and display related media objects.Note that the LightCast feed in the Fire App Builder sample app doesn’t include tags. However, there’s a fallback parameter that you can set to true if you want to show recommended content, but you don’t have tags in your feed.In your Navigator.json file (located in your app’s assets folder), the config object has a property called categoryDefaultRecommendation:  \"config\": {    \"showRecommendedContent\": true,    \"categoryDefaultRecommendation\": true,    \"searchAlgo\": \"basic\"  }If you set categoryDefaultRecommendation to true, Fire App Builder will use other media assets from the same category for the recommended content (rather than pulling content with the same tags). Note: Currently, Recommended Content matches (which are based on tags in the feed) will match unlimited content if many items have the same tags. This is a known limitation/bug.To turn off the Recommended Content section, you can set showRecommendedContent to false in Navigator.json.Next StepsNow that you’ve configured the categories and contents for your app’s media feed, you need to associate the feed with the app’s UI.

Contents recipe:  Maps the properties from your media feed, such as the titles, descriptions, video URLs, and images, to Fire App Builder’s content model.If you look at the Home screen with the default Lightcast feed, you’ll see that the media is organized in different rows. On the default home screen, you can see that media is grouped under “Jamaica Attractions” and “The Country Jamaica,” among other groups.Categories providing groupings for media.Since every media feed usually has a different structure (for example, your feed might use the term “channels” instead of “categories,” “img” instead of “image,” and so on, as well as different hierarchies and structures) you will need to write some query syntax to target the categories and content in your feed.If your feed is JSON, you will use Jayway JsonPath syntax to write the queries. If your feed is XML, you will use XPath syntax here to write the queries.After you query for the categories and content from your query, you then apply a selector to get the category or content text from the results. This selector, called matchList, doesn’t use Jayway JsonPath or XPath expressions but rather is custom Fire App Builder syntax.Next StepsSee Set Up the Category Recipe to start identifying categories in your feed. Fire App Builder will group your media based on these categories.",

(With the globalTheme property, there aren’t other values you can select.)You can assign any valid device or custom font for any of the three font options. For example, you could apply Roboto Bold to all three fonts if you want.You can use any of these device fonts:  Amazon Ember fonts: Amazon Ember, Amazon Ember Bold, Amazon Ember Bold Italic, Amazon Ember Italic, Amazon Ember Light, Amazon Ember Light Italic, Amazon Ember Medium, Amazon Ember Medium Italic, Amazon Ember Thin, Amazon Ember Thin Italic, AndroidClock Regular, AndroidClock-Large Regular  Roboto fonts: Roboto Black, Roboto Black Italic, Roboto Bold, Roboto Bold Italic, Roboto Condensed Bold, Roboto Condensed Bold Italic, Roboto Condensed Italic, Roboto Condensed Light, Roboto Condensed Light Italic, Roboto Condensed Regular, Roboto Italic, Roboto Light, Roboto Light Italic, Roboto Medium, Roboto Medium Italic, Roboto Regular, Roboto Thin, Roboto Thin Italic  Verdana fonts: Verdana, Verdana Bold, Verdana Bold Italic, Verdana Italic  Miscelleneous fonts: Carrois Gothic SC, Clockopia, Code2000, Coming Soon, Cutive Mono, Dancing Script, Dancing Script BoldDroid Sans Mono, Kindle Symbol, MotoyaLMaru W3 mono, MT Chinese Surrogates, NanumGothic, Source Code Pro MediumFor example, if you wanted to use Amazon Ember fonts, you could customize the branding object like this:  \"branding\": {    \"globalTheme\": \"AppTheme\",    \"lightFont\" : \"Amazon Ember\",    \"boldFont\" : \"Amazon Ember Bold\",    \"regularFont\" : \"Amazon Ember\"  }The screens would then look like this:And this:These Amazon Ember fonts will be used in the titles, subtitles, descriptions, body, and buttons.In addition to using different device fonts, you can also use custom fonts. If you use a custom font, store the font in your app’s assets/fonts directory. Then provide the path to the font in the branding object, such as fonts/Proxima-Nova-Light.tff (instead of just entering Proxima Nova Light):  \"branding\": {    \"globalTheme\": \"AppTheme\",    \"lightFont\" : \"fonts/Proxima-Nova-Light.tff\",    \"boldFont\" : \"fonts/Proxima-Nova-Light.tff\",    \"regularFont\" : \"fonts/Proxima-Nova-Light.tff\"  }Customize the Splash ScreenBy default, the sample app in Fire App Builder shows the following Splash screen:You can adjust the Splash screen logo in your app’s custom.xml file. The following elements correspond to the numbers in the preceding screenshot:The references to @drawable refer to images in TVUIComponent &gt; res &gt; drawable (in the Android view). Add your own app logo in this folder. Use a unique file name and update the reference in the custom.xml file to point to your images.The splash_logo should contain your logo on a transparent background. The logo image size in the sample application is 356 x 108px, but you can use a larger image if you want. The image will be scaled down automatically.Your logo appears as an overlay on top of the splash screen’s background image, so if you’re customizing the images, make sure the combination looks good. A light logo on a dark background will have the necessary contrast.You can customize other Splash screen elements by adjusting some of the properties in the &lt;!-- App colors --&gt; section. The following elements are relative to the Splash screen:&lt;!-- App colors --&gt;&lt;!-- The background color of the screens. --&gt;&lt;color name=\"background\"&gt;#22282E&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Color of splash screen spinning loader animation --&gt;&lt;color name=\"spinner_color\"&gt;#FFFFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Used for the text of a selected item's title and description.     Also used for button text, Splash screen text, and read more dialog text. --&gt;&lt;color name=\"primary_text\"&gt;#E6FFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- End of App Colors --&gt;To customize the Copyright text on the Splash screen, see the strings.xml folder inside your app’s res &gt; values &gt; strings.xml folder.&lt;!-- Copyright string --&gt;&lt;string name=\"copyright\"&gt;Copyright 2016. All Rights Reserved.&lt;/string&gt;Customize the Recommended Content SectionOn the Content Details screen, a list of “Recommended Content” appears below the content preview.You populate this section by matching certain tags in your feed. For more details on configuring Recommended Content, see “Recommended Content (Through Tags)” in Set Up the Content Recipe.Customize the Homepage LayoutThe default home screen layout uses the ContentBrowseActivity. This layout is referred to as the “Homepage Browse layout.”Home with the ContentBrowseActivity. This view arranges the videos in various channels or groups. When you view a channel, the first video in that channel group appears as the featured background image, with its title and description in the upper-left.You can change the homepage layout to a more compressed view by using the FullContentBrowseActivity instead. This alternative homepage layout is referred to as the “Homepage Full Browse layout.”Home with FullContentBrowseActivity. With this activity, all the videos appear in a more compressed grid, with the channels listed on the left. None of the videos are superimposed as large featured images in the background.The left sidebar can collapse in when the user is browsing through the video titles. This gives more space and focus to your video content.To change the homepage to the more compressed, Full Browse layout:  Open the Navigator.json file (located in app &gt; assets).      In the graph object, locate the CONTENT_HOME_SCREEN:    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.ContentBrowseActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_HOME_SCREEN\"    }        Change com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.ContentBrowseActivity to com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.FullContentBrowseActivity.The following diagram shows the properties you can customize on the homepage’s Browse layout (the default):The browse_background property is set through the TVUIComponent’s custom.xml file and references an image rather than a hex value.The following diagram shows the properties for the homepage’s Full Browse layout:The &lt;!-- App colors --&gt; section in your app’s custom.xml shows where many of the colors and layouts are set:&lt;!-- App colors --&gt;&lt;!-- The background color of the screens. --&gt;&lt;color name=\"background\"&gt;#22282E&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Used for card background --&gt;&lt;color name=\"card_background\"&gt;#2B2B2B&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Background color of the progress bar --&gt;&lt;color name=\"playback_background_progress_bar\"&gt;#FF373737&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Color of buffered progress bar --&gt;&lt;color name=\"playback_buffered_progress\"&gt;#FF5A5A5A&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Color of the progress bar --&gt;&lt;color name=\"progress_bar\"&gt;#99FFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Color of splash screen spinning loader animation --&gt;&lt;color name=\"spinner_color\"&gt;#FFFFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- The color of button highlights and widgets. --&gt;&lt;color name=\"accent\"&gt;#EE962D&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- FullContentBrowser:     The header's bar color (left-hand navigation bar). --&gt;&lt;color name=\"browse_headers_bar\"&gt;#0DFFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Used for the text of a selected item's title and description.     Also used for button text, Splash screen text, and read more dialog text. --&gt;&lt;color name=\"primary_text\"&gt;#E6FFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Used for the text on the card views and playback progress bar text. --&gt;&lt;color name=\"secondary_text\"&gt;#FFFFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- Used for the category titles and content subtitles --&gt;&lt;color name=\"tertiary_text\"&gt;#99FFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;&lt;!-- End of App Colors --&gt;See the following table for more details.                                    Element         Description                           background_gradient_start         Does nothing. Ignore.                     background_gradient_end         Does nothing. Ignore.                     browse_headers_bar         Changes the color of the left navigation bar when you're in the compressed homepage layout.                     browse_header_selected         Does nothing. Ignore.                     browse_header         Does nothing. Ignore.                     browse_row_header         For the homepage Browse layout, changes the category title above the videos rows. For the Full Browse layout, changes the color of the category titles in the left navigation bar. Both the selected and non-selected category titles receive this color. The selected category titles are bold, and the non-selected category titles are softer and muted.                     search_orb         Does nothing. Ignore.                     browse_header_text         Changes the size of the category titles.                     company_logo         This image is stored in TVUIComponent &gt; res &gt; drawable. Replace the image with your own logo. The image should be transparent and at least 356px wide by 108px tall. You can use a larger image &mdash; it will be scaled down in the app.                     browse_bg_color         The background image used for both the Full Browse layout and the Splash screen. This image is stored in TVUIComponent &gt; res &gt; drawable. The image is a 1900 x 1080px PNG image with a black color.                     browse_background         This element isn't included in application's custom.xml file &mdash; Ignore. You can simply add the line. This element controls the background image used for the homepage Browse layout. More details about this image are listed below.                     browse_bg_color         This element isn't included in application's custom.xml file &mdash; Ignore. You can simply add the line. This element controls the background image used for the homepage Full Browse layout. More details about this image are listed below.         Background Image for Homepage Browse LayoutThe background color for the homepage Browse layout (the default) isn’t configurable through the custom.xml values above because there’s a line missing in custom.xml:    &lt;drawable name=\"browse_background\"&gt;@drawable/bg_generic&lt;/drawable&gt;You can add this line to your application’s custom.xml file and control your background image file used here. Alternatively, you can edit the custom.xml inside TVUIComponent &gt; res &gt; values &gt; custom.xml. (The custom.xml file in your app just overwrites the other values in XML files, so setting the property in either file will work. But as a best practice, leave the component files unedited and just edit your application’s config.xml file.)Like the browse_bg_color element, the drawable image referenced here is stored in TVUIComponent &gt; res &gt; drawable (assuming you’re browsing in the Android view).The bg_generic.png image looks like this:bg_generic.png. The image is a 1900 x 1080px PNG image with transparency in the upper-right area.To change this default image, create your own image file with the same dimensions. Make the upper-right corner transparent, similar to the existing image. Name it bg_generic.png and replace the existing file in TVUIComponent &gt; res &gt; drawable.To make it easy to customize the image, you can download the Photoshop file used to create the image. In Photoshop, view the image’s layers and use the Paint Bucket tool to apply a new color to the two layers.

        "content": "Crashlytics (by Fabric) provides analytics around app crashes. According to Crashlytics:  Crashlytics is the #1 crash reporting platform for iOS and Android. With Crashlytics, you get real-time information on crashes inside your app, and all the details you need to tackle the most impactful stability issues head-on. Simply including Crashlytics will enable crash reporting right away - there’s no extra code to write. — CrashlyticsYou can read more in the Crashlytics documentation for Android. The Crashlytics Component implements the IAnalytics interface. You must have a Crashlytics account to use this component.Follow these steps to configure Crashlytics:  Step 1. Get Your Crashlytics Key  Step 2. Configure the Crashlytics Component  Step 3. Make a Test Crash  Step 4. Explore the Crashlytics Dashboard  Customize the Tag NamesStep 1. Get Your Crashlytics KeyAssuming you don’t already have a Crashlytics account, sign up for one and provide details about your app:  Go to https://fabric.io/sign_up and sign up for an account.  Walk through the confirmation and welcome screens.      When you get to the “You’ll be up and running in 3 steps!” screen, ignore it.    Instead of downloading and installing the Fabric plugin with these 3 steps, ignore this screen entirely. You do not need to install the Fabric plugin in Android Studio to install or configure the Crashlytics component. This plugin simply ensures you have made updates to your code that allow Crashlytics to work. In the steps that follow, you will be making adjustments to the Fire App Builder code that will accomplish a similar end.        Go to the Install Crashlytics via Gradle page and look in the Add Your API Key section.    Assuming you’re still logged in, you’ll see your API key automatically populated in the code sample:    The code samples automatically populate with your API key.    Copy this API key into a convenient place to use in later steps.(If you already have an existing Crashlytics account and have viewed crashlytics stats previously, you can also view your API key from your organization’s settings. See Fabric API Keys.)Step 2. Configure the Crashlytics ComponentThese instructions assume you’re in the Android view.      Remove any other analytics components that are loaded in your app (such as FlurryAnalyticsComponent, OmnitureAnalyticsComponent, GoogleAnalyticsComponent, or LoggerAnalyticsComponent). See Remove a Component for details.     Note: You can load only one component per interface. For example, you cannot load both the Flurry Analytics component and the Omniture Analytics component, because both components use the same IAnalytics interface. For a list of the components by interface, see Components Overview.        Load the Crashlytics component into your app. See Load a Component in Your App for details about how to load a component into your app.     Note: Initially you will see an error message after you click Sync Gradle and Gradle tries to get the necessary resources. This is because Crashlytics requires a valid API key entered into its AndroidManifest.xml file — but the CrashlyticsComponent directory won’t be visible in your Android project until you sync Gradle. Disregard the Gradle build error for now.        Uncomment the code as indicated by the “//Uncomment when using CrashlyticsComponent” comments. The following code sample shows the code correctly uncommented:    // Uncomment when using CrashlyticsComponentapply plugin: 'io.fabric'apply from: \"../artifacts.gradle\"repositories {    // Uncomment when using CrashlyticsComponent    maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' }}buildscript {    repositories {        jcenter()        // Uncomment when using CrashlyticsComponent        maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' }    }    dependencies {        classpath 'me.tatarka:gradle-retrolambda:3.2.3'        // Uncomment when using CrashlyticsComponent        classpath 'io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+'    }}        Go to CrashlyticsComponent &gt; manifests and open the AndroidManifest.xml file. Insert your Crashlytics key in the value property:    android:value=\"your_fabric_api_account_key\"/&gt;            Go to CrashlyticsComponent &gt; res &gt; values &gt; values.xml. Insert your Crashlytics key in the your_api_key string:    &lt;string name=\"your_api_key\"&gt;your_api_key&lt;/string&gt;        Click the Sync Gradle button .  Build and run your app.When you build and run your app, Crashlytics will detect that your code is correctly configured. At this point, you will no longer be blocked at the Crashlytics onboarding screen and will be able to proceed to your Crashlytics dashboard.When Fabric detects that your Crashlytics configuration is correct (based on you building your app), you see a screen like this that lets you proceed to your Dashboard, where you can view your crash analytics.Step 3. Make a Test CrashTo test out the Crashlytics configuration, perform a test crash:  In the Android view, go to TVUIComponent &gt; java &gt; com.amazon.android &gt; tv.tenfoot &gt; ui &gt; fragments and open the ContentDetailsFragment.java file.      Add the following inside the onStart() method near the top:    if(true) {throw new RuntimeException(\"Causing fake crash for Crashlytics test\");}        Click the Run ‘app’ button   to start your app.When the app starts, it immediately crashes. If you filter your logcat console by the keyword “crashlytics”, you’ll see the following logs:07-01 13:04:02.021 28688-28688/com.amazon.android.calypso D/CrashlyticsAnalyticsModuleInitReceiver: IAnalyticsModule initialized.07-01 13:04:02.064 28688-28688/com.amazon.android.calypso I/CrashlyticsCore: Initializing Crashlytics 2.3.8.9707-01 13:04:04.296 28688-28787/com.amazon.android.calypso I/CrashlyticsCore: Crashlytics report upload complete: 5776CC9E029B-0001-6E05-6C83E6F7D1F2.clsStep 4. Explore the Crashlytics DashboardAfter you have set up the code, run the app, and caused a crash, Crashlytics will let you bypass the onboarding page and take you to the Dashboard where you can view details about the crash.  Log into Crashlytics.  Click Dashboard in the upper-right corner.  View the information and settings on the Dashboard.Sample crash appearing in the Crashlytics DashboardCustomize the Tag NamesYou can customize the names of the analytics tags. (Tags are action or attribute names). Customizing the names can make it easier to identify activities you’re interested in.The complete list of analytics tags are available in AnalyticsTags.java (inside AnalyticsInterface &gt; java &gt; com.amazon.analytics &gt; AnalyticsTags).Here’s an example tag:public static final String ACTION_START_APP = \"ACTION_START_APP\";ACTION_START_APP (on the left) is the tag, and ACTION_START_APP (on the right) is how the tag appears in your analytics. In this case, it’s the same.To customize these tags with your own names:  Browse to your app’s assets &gt; configurations directory.  Add a JSON file to this directory called CrashlyticsCustomAnalyticsTags.json.      Add the tags you want to customize using the following format:    {  \"TAG\": \"value\",  \"TAG\": \"value\"}        For example, to customize the ACTION_START_APP and ACTION_SEARCH tags, add them like this:    {  \"ACTION_START_APP\":\"Start App\",  \"ACTION_SEARCH\": \"Search\"}        The values on the right map to the analytics tags in AnalyticsTags.java. The values on the left map to the new values for the tags.    If you add a tag that is not customizable, you will see a warning in the logs indicating that it cannot be customized. The customization will be ignored.  ",

For example, you cannot load both the Flurry Analytics component and the Omniture Analytics component, because both components use the same IAnalytics interface. For a list of the components by interface, see Components Overview.

Tip: As a best practice to integrate future updates, always copy values from the component’s XML files into your app’s custom.xml file. Your app’s XML values will overwrite any values in your component’s XML files.    The encrypted_flurry_api_key string will hold the encrypted version of your Flurry API key. The flurry_key_[#] strings are used to create the encryption.  Step 3. Encrypt your Flurry API KeyYou must encrypt your Flurry API key.  Open your app’s custom.xml file (inside res &gt; values).      Type a random alphanumeric string for each of the flurry_key_[#] values. For example:    &lt;string name=\"flurry_key_1\"&gt;flurryblurry8837&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"flurry_key_2\"&gt;furryBEAR2999&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"flurry_key_3\"&gt;homer2YHfurrybaLL28_sneezun&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"flurry_key_4\"&gt;curry88fl@vrczng&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"flurry_key_5\"&gt;someFlurryBlurry9911&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"flurry_key_6\"&gt;yrrulFbackwardZZ44&lt;/string&gt;        In the Android View, expand the Utils &gt; java &gt; com &gt; amazon &gt; utils &gt; security folder and open the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility class.      In the getRandomStringsForKey() method, enter the values you used for flurry_key_1, flurry_key_2, and flurry_key_3 respectively.    For example, assuming these first 3 keys are the ones displayed in the previous code sample, you would enter the following:    private static String[] getRandomStringsForKey() {    return new String[]{            \"flurryblurry8837\",            \"furryBEAR2999\",            \"homer2YHfurrybaLL28_sneezun\"    };}        In this example, the values are as follows:          flurryblurry8837 is the value used for flurry_key_1.      furryBEAR2999 is the value used for flurry_key_2.      homer2YHfurrybaLL28_sneezun is the value used for flurry_key_3.            In the getRandomStringsForIv() method, enter the values you used for flurry_key_4, random_key_5, random_key_6 respectively. For example:        private static String[] getRandomStringsForIv() {        return new String[]{                \"someFlurryBlurry9911\",                \"calypsoIslandShipBLLd99\",                \"yrrulFbackwardZZ44\"        };    }}        In this example, the values are as follows:          someFlurryBlurry9911 is the value used for flurry_key_4.      someFlurryBlurry9911 is the value used for flurry_key_5.      yrrulFbackwardZZ44 is the value used for flurry_key_6.            In the getPlainTextToEncrypt() method, insert your Flurry API key in place of Encrypt_this_text:     private static String getPlainTextToEncrypt() {        return \"Encrypt_this_text\";    }        Right-click the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility.java file and select Run ‘ResourceObfusc…main().      Look for the encrypted result printed to the console. It will look something like this:    Encrypted version of plain text 123456789 is Hgei944983ljdfHoaQ==            Copy your encrypted Flurry API key and paste it into the encrypted_flurry_api_key string’s value in your app’s custom.xml file. For example:    &lt;string name=\"encrypted_flurry_api_key\"&gt;Hgei944983ljdfHoaQ==&lt;/string&gt;         Tip: Save your random keys in a safe place, such as your company wiki, so that you always have an easy way to retrieve them. You will need these keys to decrypt the value.  Flurry Analytics is now integrated into your app and will start sending in information about events.Checking Flurry in Your LogsWhen you build your app, view logcat with a filter on the word “flurry” to see how the Flurry Analytics Component gets triggered with events.Although it takes several hours before the activity data populates in Flurry Analytic’s dashboards, you can see event logs in a matter of minutes. In Flurry Analytics, go to Events &gt; Event Logs.Customize the Tag NamesYou can customize the names of the analytics tags. (Tags are action or attribute names). Customizing the names can make it easier to identify activities you’re interested in.The complete list of analytics tags are available in AnalyticsTags.java (inside AnalyticsInterface &gt; java &gt; com.amazon.analytics &gt; AnalyticsTags).Here’s an example tag:public static final String ACTION_START_APP = \"ACTION_START_APP\";ACTION_START_APP (on the left) is the tag, and ACTION_START_APP (on the right) is how the tag appears in your analytics. In this case, it’s the same.To customize these tags with your own names:  Browse to your app’s assets &gt; configurations directory.  Add a JSON file to this directory called FlurryCustomAnalyticsTags.json.      Add the tags you want to customize using the following format:    {  \"TAG\": \"value\",  \"TAG\": \"value\"}        For example, to customize the ACTION_START_APP and ACTION_SEARCH tags, add them like this:    {  \"ACTION_START_APP\":\"Start App\",  \"ACTION_SEARCH\": \"Search\"}        The values on the right map to the analytics tags in AnalyticsTags.java. The values on the left map to the new values for the tags.    If you add a tag that is not customizable, you will see a warning in the logs indicating that it cannot be customized. The customization will be ignored.  ",

        "title": "Google Analytics Component",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The Google Analytics Component allows you to gather analytics from your Android app using Google Analytics. You can learn more about the analytics service by going to Google Analytics.Configuring the component requires you to set up a google-services.json file that you generate from Google Analytics. You then match up dimensions and metrics indexes between Google Analytics and the component in Fire App Builder. You also need to set up custom reports that contain the dimensions and metrics you want.To configure the Google Analytics Component, complete each of the following sections.  Step 1. Configure the Google Analytics Component  Step 2. Set Up the google-services.json File  Step 3. Set Up Dimensions  Step 4. Set Up Metric Indexes  Step 5. Set Up Reports  Step 6. Verify Everything Is WorkingStep 1. Configure the Google Analytics Component      Remove any other analytics components that are loaded in your app (such as Crashlytics, FlurryAnalyticsComponent, OmnitureAnalyticsComponent, or LoggerAnalyticsComponent). See Remove a Component for details.     Note: You can load only one component per interface. For example, you cannot load both the Flurry Analytics component and the Omniture Analytics component, because both components use the same IAnalytics interface. For a list of the components by interface, see Components Overview.        Load the Google Analytics component into your app. See Load a Component in Your App for details about how to load a component into your app.        Click the Sync Gradle button .  Step 2. Set Up the google-services.json FileGoogle Analytics packages all of your analytics settings into a google-services.json file. After you generate and download this file, you will place it in the Google Analytics Component folder.  Sign in to your Google account.  On the Google Analytics site, go to Add Analytics to Your Android App.  In the Get a configuration file section, click Get a Configuration File.  Enter an App name and an Android package name.          For the App name, type the name of your app.      For the Android package name, use the package name in the Google Analytics Component’s AndroidManifest.xml file: com.amazon.analytics.google.            Click Continue to choose and configure services.    Although the screen says “Select which Google services you’d like to add to your app below,” only Analytics is available for integration.    Click Continue to generate configuration files.  Click Download google-services.json and download the JSON file.  Move the google-services.json file into your GoogleAnalyticsComponent folder. (If you’re in the Android view, switch to the Project view to see this file.)Step 3. Set Up DimensionsIn this step you will set up dimensions in your app that correspond with dimensions that you set up in Google Analytics.According to Google Analytics’ documentation, “Dimensions are attributes of your data. For example, the dimension City indicates the city, for example, ‘Paris’ or ‘New York’, from which a session originates. The dimension Page indicates the URL of a page that is viewed.”To set up dimensions:      In your app, expand GoogleAnalyticsComponent &gt; assets &gt; configurations and open the GoogleCustomDimensionsTags.json file.    {  \"ATTRIBUTE_PLATFORM\": \"1\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_SEARCH_TERM\": \"2\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_PLAY_SOURCE\": \"3\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_ERROR_MSG\": \"10\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_PURCHASE_TYPE\": \"7\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_PURCHASE_RESULT\": \"8\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_PURCHASE_SKU\": \"9\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_TITLE\": \"4\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_SUBTITLE\": \"5\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_VIDEO_TYPE\": \"6\"}            Copy the file’s contents and create a similarly named file in your app’s assets &gt; configurations folder. (Any files in your app will overwrite similar files in the component. This will help you apply updates to Fire App Builder later on.)    You will be creating dimensions in Google Analytics that correspond with the dimensions and indexes here. (You don’t need to do anything with the code here just yet. Just leave the file open to adjust later.)    Sign in to your Google Analytics Dashboard.  Click Admin on the top navigation row.      In the Property column (the middle column), click Custom Definitions &gt; Custom Dimensions.            Click the New Custom Dimension button.     Warning: You can create only 20 dimensions. Also, you cannot edit a dimension once you create it, so be careful here. If you make a mistake and need to change things, you may need to sign in with a different Google account.    Type a friendly name for the first dimension. For example, type Platform instead of ATTRIBUTE_PLATFORM.  Leave the Scope as Hit (the default).  Leave Active check box selected.      Click Create.        Click Done.  Repeat this process until you have created a custom dimension for all of the following values:          Platform      Search Term      Error Message      Playback Source      Purchase Source      Purchase Result      Purchase SKU      Title      Subtitle      Video Type      Purchase Type         Note: The names here (for example, Platform) do not need to match up with the names in the GoogleCustomDimensionsTags.json file (for example, ATTRIBUTE_PLATFORM). Google will match up the dimensions based on the index values.        In the GoogleCustomDimensionsTags.json file (inside your app’s assets &gt; configurations folder), change the index numbers to correspond with the auto-created dimension index numbers (highlighted in yellow in the screenshot below) in your Google Analytics Dashboard.        (Since you can’t customize the index values in Google Analytics, you have to make the index values in the component match up with the index values Google creates.)    {\"ATTRIBUTE_PLATFORM\": \"1\",\"ATTRIBUTE_SEARCH_TERM\": \"2\",\"ATTRIBUTE_PLAY_SOURCE\": \"3\",\"ATTRIBUTE_ERROR_MSG\": \"10\",\"ATTRIBUTE_PURCHASE_TYPE\": \"7\",\"ATTRIBUTE_PURCHASE_RESULT\": \"8\",\"ATTRIBUTE_PURCHASE_SKU\": \"9\",\"ATTRIBUTE_TITLE\": \"4\",\"ATTRIBUTE_SUBTITLE\": \"5\",\"ATTRIBUTE_VIDEO_TYPE\": \"6\"}        Unless you created the dimensions in Google in the exact same order, it’s likely that your index values will be somewhat different. Just make sure each dimension you created in Google Analytics (for example, Error Message, 10) corresponds with the dimensions and indexes in your component (for example, \"ATTRIBUTE_ERROR_MSG\": \"10\").  Step 4. Set Up Metric IndexesIn this section, you’ll do the same thing you did in the previous section but with metric indexes. According to Google Analytics’ documentation, “Metrics are quantitative measurements. The metric Sessions is the total number of sessions. The metric Pages/Session is the average number of pages viewed per session.”      Expand GoogleAnalyticsComponent &gt; assets &gt; configurations and open the GoogleCustomMetricTags.json file.    {  \"ATTRIBUTE_AD_SECONDS_WATCHED\": \"1\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_VIDEO_SECONDS_WATCHED\": \"2\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_VIDEO_ID\": \"3\",  \"ATTRIBUTE_AD_ID\": \"4\"}            Copy the file’s contents and create a similarly named file in your app’s assets &gt; configurations folder.    Similar to dimensions, you will be creating metrics in Google Analytics that correspond with the metrics and indexes here. (You don’t need to do anything with the code here just yet. Just leave the file open to adjust later.)    Sign in to your Google Analytics Dashboard.  Click Admin on the top navigation row.  In the Property column (the middle), click Custom Definitions &gt; Custom Metrics.      Click the New Custom Metric button.     Warning: You can create only 20 metrics. Also, you cannot edit a metric once you create it, so be careful here. If you mess up and need to change things, you may need to sign in with a different Google account.    Type a friendly name for the first metric. For example, type Ad Seconds Watched instead of ATTRIBUTE_VIDEO_SECONDS_WATCHED.  Leave the other values (Scope, Formatting Type, Minimum Value, Maximum Value, and Active) at the defaults unless you specifically want to adjust these values.  Click Create.  Click Done.  Repeat this process until you have created a custom dimension for all of the following values:          Ad Seconds Watched      Video Seconds Watched      Video ID      Ad ID         Note: As before, the names here (for example, Ad Seconds Watched) do not need to match up with the names in the GoogleCustomMetricTags.json file (for example, ATTRIBUTE_VIDEO_SECONDS_WATCHED). Google will match up the metrics based on the index values.        In the GoogleCustomMetricTags.json file (inside your app’s assets &gt; configurations folder), change the metrics index numbers to correspond with the auto-created metric index numbers in your Google Analytics Dashboard.    (Since you can’t customize the index values in Google Analytics, you have to make the index values in the component match up with the index values Google creates.)  Step 5. Set Up ReportsThe final step is to create a report based on the dimensions and metrics in the component. Note: Only minimal information for creating custom reports is provided here. For full documentation, see Custom dimensions &amp; metrics in the Google documentation. You will need to choose how you want to match up the dimensions and metrics in your reports based on the information that’s important to you.  In Google Analytics, click Customization.  Click the New Custom Report button.  Give your custom report a Title.  In the Dimensions section, click + add dimension, expand Custom Dimensions, and select the dimensions you want.      In the Metrics Groups section, click + add metric, expand Custom Metrics, and select the metrics you want.        Make any other adjustments to your report, and click Save.Step 6. Verify Everything Is WorkingYou can verify the Google integration by doing the following:  In Android Studio, launch your app.      In Google Analytics, click Reporting and then go to Real-Time &gt; Overview.    You should see an active user.      ",

Inside this new AdobeMobileLibrary folder, put the JAR file that Adobe gives you.    For example, if the JAR file were named adobeMobileLibrary-4.6.1.jar, the path to the file would look like this:  (your app) &gt; AdobeMobileLibrary &gt; adobeMobileLibrary-4.6.1.jar.

Configure the Adobe Pass Auth Component in Your AppThe Adobe Pass Auth Component provides three separate groups of files you can customize that configure the Adobe Pass information and the Fire TV user interface that users see.To configure the Adobe Pass Authorization Component:  Load the Adobe Pass Authorization component into your app. See Load a Component in Your App for details about how to load a component into your app.      Remove any other authentication components that are loaded in your app (such as FacebookAuthComponent or LoginWithAmazonComponent). See Remove a Component for details.     Note: You can load only one component per interface. For example, you cannot load both the Adobe Pass Auth component and the Pass Through Login component, because both components use the same IAuthentication interface. For a list of the components by interface, see Components Overview.    Go to AdobePassAuthComponent &gt; res &gt; values and open the custom.xml file.

Type any alphanumeric string for the value.              random_key_2      A random string used in encrypting the public and private keys. Type any alphanumeric string for the value.              random_key_3      A random string used in encrypting the public and private keys. Type any alphanumeric string for the value.              random_key_4      A random string used in encrypting the public and private keys. Type any alphanumeric string for the value.        Step 2. Encrypt Your Adobe Primetime KeysWhen you set up an Adobe Primetime account, you’re provided with a public and private key. To keep these values secure, the Adobe Pass Component in Fire App Builder encrypts the keys with a security algorithm. The algorithm is implemented through the ResourceObfuscator and ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility classes in your app’s Utils folder.To encrypt your Adobe Primetime public and private key:  In the Android View, expand the Utils &gt; java &gt; com &gt; amazon &gt; utils &gt; security folder and open the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility class.      In the getRandomStringsForKey() method, enter the values you used for random_key_1, random_key_4, and random_key_3 (in the component’s custom.xml file) respectively.    For example, suppose you used the following random strings in your custom.xml file:    &lt;string name=\"random_key_1\"&gt;calypso&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"random_key_2\"&gt;dadadadadappppp&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"random_key_3\"&gt;more_random_stuff&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"random_key_4\"&gt;something_random&lt;/string&gt;        You would customize the strings in the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility class as follows:    private static String[] getRandomStringsForKey() {    return new String[]{            \"calypso\",            \"something_random\",            \"more_random_stuff\"    };}        In this example, the values are as follows:          calypso is the value used for random_key_1.      something_random is the value used for random_key_4.      more_random_stuff is the value used for random_key_3.            In the getRandomStringsForIv() method, enter the values you used for random_key_2 and random_key_3 respectively:        private static String[] getRandomStringsForIv() {        return new String[]{                \"dadadadadappppp\",                \"more_random_stuff\"        };    }}        In this example, the values are as follows:          dadadadadappppp is the value used for random_key_2.      more_random_stuff is the value used for random_key_3. (Same as before.)            In the getPlainTextToEncrypt() method, insert your Adobe Pass public key in place of Encrypt_this_text:     private static String getPlainTextToEncrypt() {        return \"Encrypt_this_text\";    }            Right-click the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility.java file and select Run ‘ResourceObfusc…main().        Look for the encrypted result printed to the console. It will look something like this:    Encrypted version of plain text 123456789 is gnobHJEIxnkBMobJk7mBaQ==            Copy your encrypted key. Paste this key into the encrypted_adobe_pass_public_key value in your app’s custom.xml file (as per the instructions in the previous section). For example:    &lt;string name=\"encrypted_adobe_pass_public_key\"&gt;gnobHJEIxnkBMobJk7mBaQ==&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"encrypted_adobe_pass_private_key\"&gt;YOUR ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY&lt;/string&gt;            Now insert your Adobe Pass private key into the getPlainTextToEncrypt() method, and run the script again (using the same random strings). Copy the encrypted key into the encrypted_adobe_pass_private_key string value in your app’s custom.xml file. For example:    &lt;string name=\"encrypted_adobe_pass_public_key\"&gt;gnobHJEIxnkBMobJk7mBaQ==&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"encrypted_adobe_pass_private_key\"&gt;bhjKDUYhdlkNNbUEYyvbn==&lt;/string&gt;         Tip: Save your random keys in a safe place, such as your company wiki, so that you always have an easy way to retrieve them.  Encrypting Other ValuesThe encryption utility can be used for any keys you want to encrypt in your app, not just for Adobe Primetime keys. You can use the ResourceObfuscatorStandaloneUitility class to encrypt the keys and the ResourceObfuscator class to decrypt keys.The Adobe Pass Component already leverages the ResourceObfuscator class to decrypt the keys. The random strings you entered (in the custom.xml file in the component) get passed into the ResourceObfuscator class, which does the encryption. The AdobepassRestClient.java class in the Adobe Pass Auth Component instantiates this ResourceObfuscator class and passes in your random strings:  ResourceObfuscator obfuscator = new ResourceObfuscator();        String plainKey = obfuscator.unobfuscate(key, getRandomStringsForKey(appContext),                                                 getRandomStringsForIv(appContext));        return plainKey;    }Note that this encryption technique is not hack proof. There are stronger methods of encryption. However, the algorithm does help prevent malicious users from easily finding and using your keys.Step 3. Configure the Strings for the Adobe Primetime Login PromptYou can configure the strings that appear in the Adobe Primetime Login prompt screen:Adobe Primetime login promptYou can also control the text in the error messages screen that appears if the login fails:Adobe Pass error messagesTo customize the text on these screens:  Go to AdobepassAuthComponent &gt; res &gt; values and open the strings.xml file.      Customize the string values for each of the elements.    &lt;string name=\"app_name\"&gt;AdobepassAuthComponent&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"title_activity_adobe_authentication\"&gt;Authentication&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"adobepass_login_instruction_line_1\"&gt;Go to your computer or mobile device&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"adobepass_login_instruction_line_3\"&gt;Enter the following case-sensitive code:&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"adobepass_login_instruction_line_4\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"btn_submit\"&gt;SUBMIT&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"btn_get_new_code\"&gt;GET NEW CODE&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"adobe_pass_error_authentication_message\"&gt;There was an error authenticating the account. Please try again later.&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"adobe_pass_error_registration_message\"&gt;There was an error authenticating the account. Please try again later.&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string name=\"adobe_pass_no_authorization_message\"&gt;Your subscription package does not include this video.      Step 4. Customize the Styles for the Adobe Pass ScreensYou can customize the logo and colors of the Adobe Primetime login user interface in your app.To customize the styles:  Go to AdobepassAuthComponent &gt; res &gt; values and open the styles.xml file.      Customize the string values for each of the elements. See the preceding screenshots to see how the element names and text affects the display.        &lt;style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"android:Theme.Holo.Light.DarkActionBar\"&gt;    &lt;/style&gt;    &lt;drawable name=\"company_logo\"&gt;@drawable/logo&lt;/drawable&gt;    &lt;drawable name=\"splash_background\"&gt;@drawable/bg_generic_nopreview&lt;/drawable&gt;    &lt;drawable name=\"action_button_focused\"&gt;@drawable/btn_generic_focused&lt;/drawable&gt;    &lt;color name=\"action_button_text_color\"&gt;#E6FFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;    &lt;color name=\"action_button_text_color_focused\"&gt;#E6FFFFFF&lt;/color&gt;    &lt;drawable name=\"action_button_normal\"&gt;@drawable/btn_normal&lt;/drawable&gt;      Step 5. Configure Which Screen to Prompt Users to Log inYou need to configure which screens should implement the authentication. For example, you might want to require authentication only for the PlaybackActivity on the Content Renderer screens, so that unauthenticated users can be enticed by the media in your app and be motivated to sign in.To configure which screens require authentication:  Open the Navigator.json file (located in app &gt; assets).      In the graph object, locate the activity you want to restrict (such as PlaybackActivity), and change verifyScreenAccess to true. For example:    \"com.amazon.android.uamp.ui.PlaybackActivity\": {  \"verifyScreenAccess\": true,  \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,  \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_RENDERER_SCREEN\"}      Show the Logo of the Logged-in ProviderWhen a user logs in to a provider through Adobe Pass, you can show the provider logo on the screen of the app. You do this by supplying an MVPD URL that contains the MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) along with the MVPD’s logo.In your app’s custom.xml file, add a string called mvpd_url pointing to your MVPD data, like this:&lt;string name=\"mvpd_url\"&gt;http://somedomain.com/where/my/mvpd/details/reside&lt;/string&gt;The MVPD URL must include data in the following format:{   \"mvpdWhitelist\":[      {         \"mvpd\":\"xyz123\",         \"loggedInImage\":\"http://www.xyz123.mysite.com/content/myimage.png\"      },      {         \"mvpd\":\"qrs456\",         \"loggedInImage\":\"http://www.qrs456.mysite.com/content/myfile.png\"      }   ]}Although your MVPD data will most likely contain more values, only the ones above are necessary for Fire App Builder to display the logo of the logged in provider.",

Get a Facebook App ID and Client Token  Step 2. Configure Your App  Step 3. Encrypt the Facebook App ID and Token Values  Step 4. Decide When to Prompt Users to Log In  Step 5. Customize the UI TextStep 1. Get a Facebook App ID and Client TokenFirst you must set up a Facebook app to get the app ID and client token. Note that the app name you choose will be visible when users log in via their computer browsers, so choose a name (usually your Fire TV app’s name) that you want users to see.Note that these instructions were written in June 2016. Facebook may have changed some of the button names, steps, or workflow since that time.To create a Facebook app:  Go to Register and Configure an App in the Facebook for Developers site and create a Facebook app. Be sure to follow steps 1, 2, and 3.  After you click Create new Facebook App in step 3, select Android.  In the “Quick Start for Android” screen, type a name for your app (use the same name as your Fire TV app). Then click Create New Facebook App ID.  Complete the required fields to create a Facebook app. In the “Tell us about your Android project” section, note that the “Package Name” and “Default Activity Class Name” are required but won’t actually be used since these fields relate to Google Play.  When you click Next, you’re prompted with a “Google Play Package Name” dialog box indicating that it can’t find your package name in Google Play. Click Use this package name to ignore the message.  An additional section appears: “Add your development and release key hashes.” Follow the steps in this section to generate a key hash and add it in the Key Hashes field. Then click Next.  You’ve finished the Quick Start for Android. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select My Apps and select your new app.  In the left sidebar, under PRODUCTS, click + Add Product.  Next to Facebook Login, click Get Started.      In the Client OAuth Settings section, turn on Login from Devices.    Client OAuth settings for your Facebook app.    Click Save Changes.  In the left sidebar, click Settings &gt; Basic. Copy the App ID into a convenient place.  In the left sidebar, click Settings &gt; Advanced. Copy the Client Token into a convenient place.Step 2. Configure Your AppThe Facebook Auth Component should already be loaded in the sample app in Fire App Builder, but you will need to configure the component.  The Facebook Auth Component is already loaded in the sample app built with Fire App Builder. If it isn’t loaded due to updates you’ve made, see Load a Component in Your App.      Remove any other authentication components that are loaded in your app (such as AdobepassAuthComponent or LoginWithAmazonComponent). See Remove a Component for details.     Note: You can load only one component per interface. For example, you cannot load both the Adobe Pass Auth component and the Pass Through Login component, because both components use the same IAuthentication interface. For a list of the components by interface, see Components Overview.  Step 3. Encrypt the Facebook App ID and Token ValuesYou must insert an encrypted version of the Facebook app ID and client token into your app. To encrypt your app ID and client token:  Expand the FacebookAuthComponent &gt; res &gt; values folder and open the strings.xml file.      Copy the following strings and paste them into your app’s custom.xml file:    &lt;string name=\"encrypted_fb_client_token\"&gt;YOUR_ENCRYPTED_FB_APP_CLIENT_TOKEN&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"encrypted_fb_app_id\"&gt;YOUR_ENCRYPTED_FB_APP_ID&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_1\"&gt;fb_random_key_1&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_2\"&gt;fb_random_key_2&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_3\"&gt;fb_random_key_3&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_4\"&gt;fb_random_key_4&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_5\"&gt;fb_random_key_5&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_6\"&gt;fb_random_key_6&lt;/string&gt;         Tip: As a best practice to integrate future updates, always copy values from the component’s XML files into your app’s custom.xml file. Your app’s XML values will overwrite any values in your component’s XML files.    The encrypted_authentication_client_token is the encrypted version of the client token you generated when you created your Facebook app. The encrypted_authentication_app_id is the encrypted version of the Facebook app ID. You’ll encrypt these values in the upcoming steps. The random keys are used to create the encryption.        Type a random alphanumeric string for each of these fb_key_[#] values. For example:    &lt;string name=\"fb_key_1\"&gt;odysseusgrEEk2000bc&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_2\"&gt;helengreekFAce5000ships&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_3\"&gt;homer@1storyTllr20&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_4\"&gt;latinusOdysseusson332&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_5\"&gt;calypsoIslandShipBLLd99&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"fb_key_6\"&gt;athenazeusEPICodysseY77&lt;/string&gt;        In the Android View, expand the Utils &gt; java &gt; com &gt; amazon &gt; utils &gt; security folder and open the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility class.      In the getRandomStringsForKey() method, enter the values you used for fb_key_1, fb_key_2, and fb_key_3 respectively.    For example, assuming these first 3 keys are the ones displayed in the previous code sample, you would enter the following:    private static String[] getRandomStringsForKey() {    return new String[]{            \"odysseusgrEEk2000bc\",            \"helengreekFAce5000ships\",            \"homer@1storyTllr20\"    };}        In this example, the values are as follows:          odysseusgrEEk2000bc is the value used for fb_key_1.      helengreekFAce5000ships is the value used for fb_key_2.      homer@1storyTllr20 is the value used for fb_key_3.            In the getRandomStringsForIv() method, enter the values you used for fb_key_4, random_key_5, and random_key_6 respectively. For example:        private static String[] getRandomStringsForIv() {        return new String[]{                \"latinusOdysseusson332\",                \"calypsoIslandShipBLLd99\",                \"athenazeusEPICodysseY77\"        };    }}        In this example, the values are as follows:          latinusOdysseusson332 is the value used for fb_key_4.      calypsoIslandShipBLLd99 is the value used for fb_key_5.      athenazeusEPICodysseY77 is the value for fb_key_6.            In the getPlainTextToEncrypt() method, insert your Facebook client token in place of Encrypt_this_text:     private static String getPlainTextToEncrypt() {        return \"Encrypt_this_text\";    }            Right-click the ResourceObfuscationStandaloneUtility.java file and select Run ‘ResourceObfusc…main().        Look for the encrypted result printed to the console. It will look something like this:    Encrypted version of plain text 123456789 is mTWxLhZeHslQFwpN3irjfQ==            Copy your encrypted app ID and paste it into the encrypted_fb_client_token string’s value in your app’s custom.xml file. For example:    &lt;string name=\"encrypted_fb_client_token\"&gt;rneiu89EIxnk9489faoPoaQ&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"encrypted_fb_app_id\"&gt;YOUR_ENCRYPTED_FB_APP_ID&lt;/string&gt;            Now insert your Facebook app ID into the getPlainTextToEncrypt() method, and run the script again (using the same random strings). Copy the encrypted key into the encrypted_fb_app_id string value in your app’s custom.xml file. For example:    &lt;string name=\"encrypted_adobe_pass_public_key\"&gt;gnobHJEIxnkBMobJk7mBaQ==&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"encrypted_adobe_pass_private_key\"&gt;AQ/9Qtc26GzLVSHRe1ftPw==&lt;/string&gt;         Tip: Save your random keys in a safe place, such as your company wiki, so that you always have an easy way to retrieve them. You will need these keys to decrypt the value.  Step 4. Decide When to Prompt Users to Log In{#step4}You can configure the screen where users should be prompted to log in to Facebook.  Open the Navigator.json file (located in your app’s assets folder).      Set the verifyScreenAccess value to true for the screen where you want users to log in. For example, if you want users to log in before playing media, you would verify screen access at the PlaybackActivity:      \"com.amazon.android.uamp.ui.PlaybackActivity\": {  \"verifyScreenAccess\": true,  \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,  \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_RENDERER_SCREEN\"}        Now when users launch your app and try to watch media, they will be prompted to log in.  Step 5. Customize the UI Text{#step5}To change the text that appears in the dialog box prompting users to log in:  Go to ContentBrowser &gt; res &gt; values and open the strings.xml file.      Copy the following strings into your app’s custom.xml file (inside res &gt; values):    &lt;string name=\"optional_login_dialog_title\"&gt;Login&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"optional_login_dialog_message\"&gt;Do you want to get most of your app by logging in now?&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"now\"&gt;Now&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"later\"&gt;Later&lt;/string&gt;        Customize the string values.Disable User’s Ability to Postpone LoginBy default, users have the option of postponing the Facebook login. Currently if users click Later at this prompt, they can log in later using the Login Settings button.  Expand the FacebookAuthComponent &gt; res values folder and open the custom.xml file.      Copy the following strings into your app’s custom.xml file (inside res &gt; values):    &lt;bool name=\"is_authentication_can_be_done_later\"&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;        Change the string’s value to false.Looking at the Logs for Facebook Auth Component ActionsAfter a user has already logged in, when he or she restarts the Fire TV app, the Facebook Auth Component will automatically check to see if the user is already logged in. Filtering the logcat to show “facebook” only, you will see the following if a user is not logged in:06-24 17:39:18.602 29089-29089/com.amazon.android.calypso D/FacebookAuthenticationModuleInitReceiver: IAuthenticationModule initialized.06-24 17:39:18.684 29089-29089/com.amazon.android.calypso D/FacebookAuthentication: Facebook configured and previous access token is:06-24 17:39:43.566 29089-29089/com.amazon.android.calypso D/FacebookAuthentication: Checking if user is logged in06-24 17:39:43.569 29089-29089/com.amazon.android.calypso D/FacebookAuthentication: Access token is null.

        "content": "The Login with Amazon Component allows you to prompt users to log in to your Amazon Fire TV app using their Amazon account credentials before they perform a specific action, such as watching media. To learn more, see Login with Amazon.Since Amazon Fire TV already requires users to log in with their Amazon accounts when they set up and register their Fire TV, the real benefit of the component isn’t that it allows users to log in with their Amazon account. The component’s benefit is that it prompts users to consent to share their Amazon name and email address with your app. This allows you to get a better sense of your audience.

Get the Login with Amazon API Key          Getting Your App’s Signature      The User Experience with Login with Amazon ComponentWhen users click the Watch Now button to view media, they see a Login with Amazon button that starts the login process:Figure 1. Login with Amazon buttonAfter clicking the button, the user is presented with a secure login screen (hosted by Amazon) that shows the user’s name and email address (associated with their Fire TV account). They are asked to consent to share this data (name + email address) with the app. The consent screen shows the app name, logo, and privacy notice.Figure 2. Privacy consent screen.If users click I agree, they are redirected back to the app with a token that grants them access to watch the media.Figure 3. Success and return back to the app.Once back in the app, the user clicks Return. The media the user selected begins to play.If users do not consent to share their info with the app, they are redirected back to the app and see the same Login with Amazon screen (Figure 1) as before.Once logged in, users can log out using the Logout button at the bottom of your app. The next time users try to view media, they will be prompted to log in again (Figure 1). Since users have already consented to share their details with the app, the privacy screen (Figure 2) will be bypassed.If users want to revoke your app’s access to their data, they do the following:  Log in to https://amazon.com and go to Your Account &gt; Your Account. (Or go directly here.)  Under Settings, click Manage Login with Amazon.  Click Remove next to your app.Configuration OverviewTo configure the Login with Amazon Component, follow these steps:  Step 1. Configure Your App  Step 2. Create a Security Profile on the Developer Console  Step 3. Get the Login with Amazon API KeyStep 1. Configure Your AppTo configure the Login with Amazon Component:  As with other components, follow the general instructions to Load a Component in Your App.      Remove any other authentication components that are loaded in your app (such as AdobepassAuthComponent or FacebookAuthComponent). See Remove a Component for details.     Note: You can load only one component per interface. For example, you cannot load both the Adobe Pass Auth component and the Pass Through Login component, because both components use the same IAuthentication interface. For a list of the components by interface, see Components Overview.    In your app, open the Navigator.json file (located in app &gt; assets).      Set the verifyScreenAccess value to true for the screen where you want users to log in. For example, if you want users to log in before playing media, you would verify screen access at the PlaybackActivity:      \"com.amazon.android.uamp.ui.PlaybackActivity\": {  \"verifyScreenAccess\": true,  \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,  \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_RENDERER_SCREEN\"}        To change the text that appears in the Login with Amazon screen (Figure 1), go to LoginWithAmazonComponent &gt; res &gt; values &gt; strings.xml. Copy the strings into your app’s custom.xml file (inside res &gt; values) and customize the string values.To fully configure the component, you will need to insert the API key from the Login with Amazon service. The next sections explain how to get this API key.Step 2. Create a Security Profile on the Developer ConsoleYou must create a security profile for your app on the Developer Console. This security profile is used by the Login with Amazon service and is required to get an API key.Your security profile contains information about your app and is displayed to users on the privacy consent screen (Figure 2). On the privacy consent screen, users see the name of your application, your logo, and a link to your privacy policy.To set up your security profile, follow the instructions in the “Register Your Security Profile” section on the Register your Android app with Login with Amazon page.Step 3. Get the Login with Amazon API KeyAfter creating a security profile on the Developer Console, you must add settings for the app that will use Login with Amazon with that profile. You can then get an API key and finish configuring the Login with Amazon Component in your app.      Complete the steps in the “Adding an Android App to a Security Profile” section on the Register your Android app with Login with Amazon page. Note the following:          For the package name, open the AndroidManifest.xml file (located in your app &gt; manifests) in Android Studio. The package name is listed at the top. By default, the package name is com.amazon.android.calypso. However, you most likely changed the package name when you customized your app.      To get the MD5 and SHA-256 values for the signature fields, see the following section, Getting Your App’s Signature.            Get your API key by following the steps in the “Retrieving an Android API Key” section on the Register your Android app with Login with Amazon page.        After you get the API key, go into the LoginWithAmazonComponent &gt; assets folder in Android Studio and open the api_key.txt file. Delete all the default text that appears in that file, and then paste your API key.  Getting Your App’s SignatureYour apps must be signed in order to interact with the Login with Amazon service. Before you release your app, your signature is stored in a debug keystore. After you release your app, your signature is stored in a release keystore. The Login with Amazon service will use your app’s signature to construct the API key that is necessary to configure the Login with Amazon Component.If you’re testing out your app (that is, you haven’t yet released it to the Amazon Appstore), Android Studio automatically generates a signature for your APK file. While you’re in the coding/testing phase, you can use this signature to test the Login with Amazon functionality. When you officially release your app, you will need to generate a new API key based on the signature from the release keystore.For more information about signatures, see Android App Signatures and API Keys. See also Sign Your App in the Android documentation.To get the MD5 and SHA-256 values from your signature, you use a Java utility called keytool. To use keytool to get these values:      Add keytool to your PATH:          Locate the path to keytool. keytool is in the Home/bin directory of your JDK location. For example, on a Mac, the path is /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_91.jdk/Contents/Home/bin. (The exact path depends on your version of the JDK. Update this path based on your version.)              Add this location to your PATH. On a Mac, you can use a command such as the following:        echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_91.jdk/Contents/Home/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile                For Windows users, use Windows methods for adding tools to your PATH.                  With keytool in your PATH, browse to the folder where the debug.keystore resides. This path is as follows:    /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/.android/debug.keystore        Replace &lt;your username&gt; with your username.

The Amazon Media Player builds on ExoPlayer to provide a robust and stable media player that is compatible on Fire TV devices.The functionality in Amazon Media Player closely mirrors that in ExoPlayer. For example, Amazon Media Player supports SmoothStreaming, DASH, HLS, Dolby, captions, and more. For details about what Amazon Media Player supports, look at the documentation for ExoPlayer. The minimum Android SDK required is API level 19 (KitKat).The aim with Amazon Media Player is to develop higher level player APIs that abstract away the complex ExoPlayer APIs for core playback scenarios. Amazon Media Player provides you with a mostly fixed set of APIs that you can use even when ExoPlayer changes its APIs with version upgrades.Configure Amazon Media Player ComponentThere aren’t any options to customize the Amazon Media Player Component.

        "content": "The Amazon In-App Purchasing Component uses Amazon’s In-App Purchasing (IAP) API to integrate two different purchasing options in your app:  Daily Pass: Allows uses to watch any media in your app for a day (starting from the time of purchase for 24 hours). This is similar to an unlimited movie rental for 24 hours.  Go Premium: Allows users to pay a subscription fee to watch any media in your app during the subscription time period. You define the subscription time period when you set up the in-app items in the Amazon Developer Console.With the In-App Purchasing Component, you don’t have to worry about handling transactions with users. Users make purchases through their Amazon account, which they set up when they configure their Fire TV. The In-App Purchasing API takes care of all of the transaction details within your app. Note: You can customize the button text that says “Daily Pass” or “Go Premium.” More details about how to customize the UI strings are provided in “Customize the Button Text.”  The User Experience with Amazon In-App Purchasing Component  Notes and Limitations with In-App Purchasing  Amazon In-App Purchasing Component Workflow  Configuration Overview          Daily Pass (Consumables) and Go Premium (Subscriptions)      Amazon In-App Purchasing Component Configuration        Step 1.

Options to either subscribe or purchase a daily pass appear to the user on the Content Details screen.When a user clicks the “Go Premium” or “Daily Pass” button, the user is prompted to make a purchase using his or her Fire TV account. For example, if the user clicks “Go Premium,” the following screen appears:Figure 2. Subscription options dialog box that appears to users.If a user clicks “Daily Pass,” the following screen appears:Figure 3. Rental options dialog box that appears to users. Note: When you configure the in-app purchasing items, you can customize the text that displays in these dialog boxes.The user completes the transaction through this Fire TV dialog box using his or her Amazon account, which the user entered when setting up Fire TV. When the transaction is finished, the user sees this screen:Figure 4. The order is completed.The user can now start watching the content.Notes and Limitations with In-App PurchasingNote the following details with the Amazon In-App Purchase component:  You must offer both Daily Pass (24-hour access) and Go Premium (subscription) options for your media.  When users purchase Daily Pass or Go Premium, they get access to all the media in your app. You can’t individually separate out some items for subscription or rental while keeping other items free.  If users are in the middle of a movie when their Daily Pass or Subscription expires, the users will be able to finish their movie. The In-App Purchasing component won’t stop their movie.  You cannot offer multiple subscription types for the same media. For example, you can’t offer both an SD or HD option to watch content, nor can you offer monthly or yearly subscriptions.  Daily Pass can be used only on the device in which the purchase was made. A user cannot log into another Fire TV device and expect the Daily Pass to work.  Go Premium subscriptions work across devices (meaning a user can buy a subscription in one Fire TV device and get the same benefits on another Fire TV device). However, users who log into another device will need to restart the app before the subscription takes effect.  If a user purchases a Daily Pass, but then the Fire TV app crashes and the data is lost, the user will no longer have access to Daily Pass on the app. However, with Go Premium (subscriptions), app crashes will not void the user’s access after he or she restarts the app.  If a user subscribes to content and then clicks the Back button, he or she will see the Go Premium button again. But if the user tries to subscribe a second time, the app will recognize that the user is already a subscriber and will provide access to the media.Amazon In-App Purchasing Component WorkflowThe following steps describe the payment workflow for the Amazon In-App Purchasing Component:  When the app starts, the app uses the In-App Purchasing API to fetch the existing purchases for the current logged-in user and updates the products with the latest receipts.  On a Content Details screen, the user clicks either a Daily Pass or Go Premium button (assuming the user hasn’t yet purchased the media).  The app makes a call to the In-App Purchasing API to perform the transaction with the user for the items. The user completes the purchase through the Fire TV account options the user has already set up.  If the transaction is successful, the In-App Purchasing API returns a receipt ID from the transaction to the app.  (Optional) To ensure the receipt is valid, you can set up your own service to send a request to the Receipt Verification service and check if the receipt ID is valid.  If the receipt ID is valid, the app lets the user view the media.Configuration OverviewTo set up the In-App Purchasing Component, you create a Daily Pass item (consumable) and Go Premium item (subscription) in the In-App Items section of the Developer Portal. You configure your app with the SKU information for these items. The component sends the necessary information to the In-App Purchasing API.The Amazon In-App Purchasing Component uses a wrapper over the IAP API. Only a limited feature set from IAP is available; as such, the documentation here is a modified subset of the IAP documentation.Daily Pass (Consumables) and Go Premium (Subscriptions)In-App Purchasing offers 3 types of items: consumables, entitlements, and subscriptions. Only consumables and subscriptions are relevant to the In-App Purchasing Component in Fire App Builder (this component is a wrapper on top of the IAP API, so not all of the IAP API features apply). Both consumable and subscription items (not entitlements) map to the Amazon In-App Purchase Component.Here’s the difference between consumables and subscriptions:  Consumables (mapped to Daily Pass) are consumed within the app and can be purchased multiple times. Consumables are mapped to “Daily Pass” in Fire App Builder. Choose this type of item if you want users to have access to all your media for a 24-hour access period.  Subscriptions (mapped to Go Premium) offer access to a premium set of content or features for a limited period of time. Subscriptions are mapped to “Go Premium” in Fire App Builder. Choose this type of item if you want users to have access to all your media throughout the subscription period.Amazon In-App Purchasing Component ConfigurationTo configure the In-App Purchase Component, follow these steps:  Step 1. Create an App in the Developer Portal  Step 2. Create a Consumable (Daily Pass) In-App Item  Step 3. Create a Subscription (Go Premium) In-App Item  Step 4. Download and Push the JSON Data File  Step 5. Enable the In-App Purchasing Component in your App  Step 6. Map In-App Items to Content in Your App  Step 7. Customize the Button Text  Step 8. Set Up the App TesterStep 1. Create an App in the Developer PortalIf you have already created an app, you can skip this section jump to the next.  Log in to the Developer Portal.  Click Add a New App and select Android in the “Choose a Platform” dialog box. Then click Next.      Complete the basic fields for your app:          App title: The name of your app.      App SKU: A unique identifier for your app (for example, mycalypsomediapp1234). The SKU has a max length of 150 characters and can contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscores, periods, and dashes. SKUs are case-sensitive.      Category: Choose a category appropriate for your app and media.        For Customer Support Contact, select Use my default support information or customize the fields. Then click Save.Step 2. Create a Consumable (Daily Pass) In-App Item  Log in to the Developer Portal, go to the Dashboard, and click your app.  Click the In-App Items tab in your app.      Click the Add a Consumable button (for Daily Pass).    Figure 5. Rental options dialog box that appears to users.        Enter values for the fields defined in the following table:                Field      Description                  Title      A name to refer to this item. This title doesn’t appear to users. Type Daily Pass for convenience.              SKU      A unique-to-your-app string that becomes the ID for the item. For example, “com.amazon.example.iap.mydailypassitem”. The SKUs used by your app must match the SKUs that you submit to the Amazon Appstore. The same SKU character requirements as before (when you created an app) apply here too.              Content delivery      Choose No additional file required since the content to be delivered is included as part of the app.              Click Save.     Note: You must save the information that you have entered on one tab before moving to the next tab.        Click the Availability &amp; Pricing tab and complete the details as described in the following table.                Field      Description                  Are you charging for this consumable / entitlement?      Select Yes, my base price is… A field displays allowing you to set the base price and currency for the item. After you set the base price, you can manually set the price for other currencies, or allow the Amazon Appstore to set those prices for you, based on conversion rates and taxes. Valid prices (in USD) can either be $0.00 or range from $0.99 to $99.00.              When would you like this item to be available?      Specify a date (IAP uses the PST time zone) for the item to become available in your app. If you leave this field blank, the item will become available as soon as it is approved by the Amazon Appstore.          Click Save.  Click the Description tab.      Complete the Display Title and Description fields.    These fields appear in the dialog box after users click Daily Pass:    Figure 6. Title and Description fields that appear to users.    Click Save.  Click the Images tab.  Upload the two images as indicated based on the size requirements. Only the 114px image appears in the Daily Pass dialog box users see in the app. In the previous screenshot (Figure 6), the image is simply an orange square. For convenience in creating the 512px image, you can upload this generic image.      Click Save.     Warning: Do not click Submit In-App Item button yet. After you submit the in-app item, you cannot edit or remove it. Only click this button after you have fully tested the functionality and content and are ready to submit your app.  Step 3. Create a Subscription (Go Premium) In-App Item  If necessary, log in to the Developer Portal, go to the Dashboard, and click your app.  Click the In-App Items tab in your app.  Click the Add a Subscription button (for Go Premium). (In the “Subscriptions are not supported by Amazon Underground” prompt, click the Add a Subscription button again.)      Enter values for the fields defined in the following table:                Field      Description                  Title      A name to refer to this item. This title doesn’t appear to users. Type Go Premium for convenience.              SKU      A unique-to-your-app string that becomes the ID for the item. For example, “com.amazon.example.iap.mygopremiumitem.” The SKUs used by your app must match the SKUs that you submit to the Amazon Appstore. The same SKU character requirements as before (when you created an app) apply here too.              Content delivery      Choose No additional file required since the content to be delivered is included as part of the app.              Click Save.     Note: You must save the information that you have entered on one tab before moving to the next tab.        Click the Subscription Periods tab and complete the fields as defined in the following table.                Field      Description                  Subscription Period      Select the subscription duration you want. Subscription periods start on the date of purchase.              SKU      Enter a unique SKU (using the same guidelines as the other SKU fields) that corresponds to this subscription period. For example, “com.amazon.example.calypso.monthly”. This SKU is a child SKU of the SKU that you entered on the item detail page.              Free Trial      If desired, specify an optional free trial period for the subscription.              Are you charging for this subscription?      Select Yes, my base price is…. A field displays allowing you to set the base price and currency for the item. After you set the base price, you can manually set the price for other currencies, or allow the Amazon Appstore to set those prices for you, based on conversion rates and taxes. Valid prices (in USD) can either be $0.00 or range from $0.99 to $99.00.              When would you like this item to be available?      Specify a date (IAP uses the PST time zone) for the item to become available in your app. If you leave this field blank, the item will become available as soon as it is approved by the Amazon Appstore.           Note: Ignore the “Save and Add a Subscription Period” button. The Purchasing Component supports only one subscription period.    Click Save.  Click the Description tab.      Complete the Display Title and Description fields.    These fields appear in the dialog box after users click Go Premium:    Figure 7. Title and Description fields that appear to users.    Click Save.  Click the Images tab.  The image icons are required by the Developer Console, but unlike with Daily Pass (consumables), neither image is used in the Go Premium dialog box users see in the app. For convenience, you can upload this generic 114px image and this generic 512px image image.      Click Save.     Warning: Do not click Submit In-App Item button yet. After you submit the in-app item, you cannot edit or remove it. Only click this button after you have fully tested the functionality and content and are ready to submit your app.  Step 4. Download and Push the JSON Data FileAfter you have configured both the Daily Pass and Go Premium in-app items, you will download a JSON file containing details about your in-app items.  If necessary, log in to the Developer Portal, go to the Dashboard, and click your app.  Click the In-App Items tab in your app.      Click the JSON Data File button to download the JSON file containing your in-app item details.        In your terminal, cd to the directory containing this file.      Push the JSON file to your Fire TV device using the following command:    $ adb push amazon.sdktester.json /mnt/sdcard/        The response will show the following: [100%] /mnt/sdcard/amazon.sdktester.json  Step 5. Enable the In-App Purchasing Component in your AppNow that you’ve created your in-app items in the Developer Console, you need to enable the IAP component in your app.  Load the Amazon In-App Purchasing component into your app. See the Load a Component for details about how to load a component into your app.  In Android Studio (in the Android view), expand the ContentBrowser folder and go to res &gt; values and open the custom.xml file.      Copy the following string:    &lt;bool name=\"is_iap_disabled\"&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;        (Ignore the override_all_contents_subscription_flag field.)    In your app folder, open the custom.xml file (located in res &gt; values).      Paste the string you copied earlier and change the value to false. Make sure to paste this string inside the resources tags:    &lt;bool name=\"is_iap_disabled\"&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;         Tip: Note that this is a double negative, so in this case false is actually enabling IAP in your app.    The values in your app’s custom.xml will overwrite any values in the components.  Step 6. Map In-App Items to Content in Your App      In Android Studio (in the Android view), expand the PurchaseInterface folder and go to assets. Then open the skuslist.json file.        For “Go Premium” items, replace the fields in red with your Go Premium item’s SKU value:    {  \"skusList\": [    {      \"sku\": \"testSubSku\",      \"productType\": \"SUBSCRIBE\",      \"purchaseSku\": \"testSubSku\"    },    {      \"sku\": \"RentUnPurchased\",      \"productType\": \"RENT\",      \"purchaseSku\": \"RentUnPurchased\"    }  ],  \"actions\": {    \"CONTENT_ACTION_DAILY_PASS\": \"RentUnPurchased\",    \"CONTENT_ACTION_SUBSCRIPTION\": \"testSubSku\"  }}    Go Premium items are subscriptions.        For “Daily Pass” items, replace the fields in red with your Daily Pass item’s SKU value:    {  \"skusList\": [    {      \"sku\": \"testSubSku\",      \"productType\": \"SUBSCRIBE\",      \"purchaseSku\": \"testSubSku\"    },    {      \"sku\": \"RentUnPurchased\",      \"productType\": \"RENT\",      \"purchaseSku\": \"RentUnPurchased\"    }  ],  \"actions\": {    \"CONTENT_ACTION_DAILY_PASS\": \"RentUnPurchased\",    \"CONTENT_ACTION_SUBSCRIPTION\": \"testSubSku\"  }}    Daily Pass items are rentals.  Step 7. Customize the Button TextYou can customize the “Daily Pass” or the “Go Premium” text that appears on the buttons on the Content Details screen.To customize the text:  Go to ContentBrowser &gt; res &gt; values and open the strings.xml file.      Copy the following strings and paste them into your app’s custom.xml file:    &lt;string name=\"premium_1\"&gt;Go&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"premium_2\"&gt;Premium&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"daily_pass_1\"&gt;Daily&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"daily_pass_2\"&gt;Pass&lt;/string&gt;        You can also copy other strings related to the Purchasing Component here as well:    &lt;string name=\"iap_error_dialog_title\"&gt;Purchase Error&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"subscription_expired\"&gt;Your subscription expired!&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string name=\"ok\"&gt;Ok&lt;/string&gt;        Customize the string values as desired.Step 8. Set Up the App TesterNow that you’ve set up your in-app items and configured your app, it’s time to test out the integration and see how IAP interacts with your media.To test the in-app items in your app — without actually making purchases and before submitting your app to the Appstore — you need to use the IAP App Tester. The App Tester simulates calls to the In-App Purchasing API using a sandbox server. The App Tester intercepts the outgoing call to the In-App Purchasing API and returns a valid receipt, authorizing the transaction. (For more details, see Installing and Configuring the App Tester.)To set up the App Tester:      Using your computer’s browser, go to the App Tester from the AppStore, get the app (it’s free), and deliver it to your device.    To deliver this app to your device, you must be signed in to Amazon with the same credentials as you used in setting up your Fire TV. Use the “Deliver to” options to deliver the app to your device:    Figure 9. The Delivery options allows you to send the app to your Fire TV device.    On your Fire TV, sync your purchases with your device by going to Settings &gt; My Account &gt; Sync Amazon Content.  From the Fire TV home screen, go to Apps and select Your Apps Library.  Select the Amazon App Tester app and download and install the app from the cloud.  Launch the app after the download completes.      Click the In-App Purchasing API section.    Figure 10. In-App Purchasing API option.    Select 5. IAP Items in JSON File and verify that items from your amazon.sdktester.json file appear here.Simulate CallsWith your app and the testing tool configured, you can now simulate calls to the IAP service.  Using ADB, start your app.  Browse to media in your app.  Click the Daily Pass or Subscribe button.Adjust In-App ItemsYou may want to adjust the Title and Description fields on the Description tab based on how the text appears in your app.You can adjust the text or other features in your in-app items by logging into the Developer Console, clicking your app, and going to the In-App Items tab. As long as you haven’t submitted your app, all the fields remain editable.Reset PurchasesAs you’re testing the functionality, you can reset any Daily Pass or Go Premium purchases by doing the following:  Go to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage Installed Applications &gt; Amazon App Tester.  Select Clear data and Clear cache.Implementing Additional Security Through the Receipt Verification ServiceWhen users purchase a Daily Pass or Subscription to your media, the IAP API returns a receipt to your app indicating whether the transaction was valid. Since your users own the Fire TV device, it’s possible for hackers to re-route the outgoing call to the IAP API and spoof the receipt.To verify that the receipt returned from the IAP API is valid, you can set up your own service to call Amazon’s Receipt Verification Service.Here’s the general process for verifying receipts with the Receipt Verification Service using Fire App Builder:  You set up your own server (using any language/platform) to send the receipt and an accompanying secret to the Receipt Verification Service, asking whether the receipt is valid.  Your app sends a request with the required properties and shared secret to the Receipt Verification Service to check the receipt. The required values can be found in AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent &gt; res &gt; values values.xml.  After verifying the secret, the Receipt Verification Service determines whether the receipt is valid and responds with a true or false answer.This workflow is not included in Fire App Builder. By default, Fire App Builder just makes a call to a dummy service that always returns valid. Specifically, in Fire App Builder, the AReceiptVerifier class (in the AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent folder) is an abstract class that you extend with your own subclass to call the Receipt Verification Service.DefaultReceiptVerificationService is a sample subclass in Fire App Builder that extends AReceiptVerifier. The validateReceipt method inside DefaultReceiptVerificationService implements all the required parameters needed by the Receipt Verification Service:  context:   The application context  requestId: The request id for this request  sku:       SKU for the receipt  userData:  User data of the current user  receipt:   The receipt to validate  listener:  The listener of this request  return: The request idHowever, validateReceipt doesn’t actually call the Receipt Verification Service. Instead, this method just returns a status of successful.You must create your own subclass to extend AReceiptVerifier with an actual call to the Receipt Verification Service. (Alternatively, you can customize the DefaultReceiptVerificationService subclass.)When you create the subclass, you must provide your subclass name in your app’s custom.xml file by doing the following:  Go to AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent &gt; res &gt; values and open the strings.xml file.      Copy the following receipt_verification_service_iap string, and paste it into your app’s custom.xml file (inside app &gt; resources):    &lt;string name=\"receipt_verification_service_iap\"&gt;com.amazon.inapppurchase.DefaultReceiptVerificationService&lt;/string&gt;        In your app’s custom.xml file, update the string’s value with the complete path to your subclass. By default, the DefaultReceiptVerificationService is configured. You can either create a new subclass or simply overwrite the DefaultReceiptVerificationService class.For more details on calling the Receipt Verification Service, see Receipt Verification Service. Note: The level of security you implement depends on the resources you want to expend verifying legitimate transactions. If it makes sense to manage your own server to verify receipts (because your revenue exceeds the cost of managing your own server), you should implement this additional security with the Receipt Verification Service. However, if revenue from your app doesn’t exceed the cost or hassle of managing your own server, you might want to omit this extra setup.Submitting In-App Items to ProductionSo far this documentation has explained how to configure your app in a test environment. When you’re ready to submit your app to the app store, you need to also submit the in-app items.To submit the in-app items:  Log in to the Developer Portal, go to the Dashboard, and click your app.  Click the In-App Items tab in your app.  Click the Submit In-App Item button.After you submit your in-app items, you can no longer edit them.

        "content": "In addition to using the existing components, you can create your own components that implement the interfaces. When you create your own components, you will need to write the Java code that implements the interface.To create your own component:      Identify the interface you want to implement. See the Components Overview for a list of the various components and the interfaces each component implements.    For example, if you’re implementing an analytics component, the Components Overview notes that each analytics component implements the IAnalytics interface. Ads components implement the IAds interface, and so on.        Open the interface folder and examine the contents of the interface (or press Shift+Shift and type the interface name to search directly for it).    Continuing with the same example, the IAnalytics.java file is located in AnalyticsInterface &gt; java &gt; com.amazon.analytics &gt; IAnalytics.        Create a new component that implements each of the fields and methods of the interface. The Javadoc for each interface is available as a ZIP file download.    If you look at the Interface IAnalytics Javadoc, you will see that the following fields are required:          major      minor        And the following methods are required:          collectLifeCycleData      configure      trackAction      trackCaughtError      trackState         Tip: For an example, look at how other components have implemented the interfaces.        In your component’s AndroidManifest.xml file, follow the pattern of other Analytics components. The manifest file should contain at least the following elements (customized to your component name):    &lt;manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"          package=\"com.amazon.analytics.yourcomponentname\"&gt;        &lt;application            android:allowBackup=\"true\"            android:label=\"@string/app_name\"            android:supportsRtl=\"true\"&gt;            &lt;receiver android:name=\"com.amazon.analytics.yourcomponentname.YourComponentNameModuleInitReceiver\"                  android:enabled=\"true\"                  android:exported=\"false\"&gt;            &lt;intent-filter&gt;                &lt;action android:name=\"android.amazon.module.init\"/&gt;            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;        &lt;/receiver&gt;    &lt;/application&gt;    &lt;/manifest&gt;            In your component’s build.gradle file, again follow the example of the existing components. Your component’s build.gradle file must include the dependencies for at least the following:    dependencies {    compile fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs')        compile project(':ModuleInterface')    compile project(':AuthInterface')    compile project(':Utils')}            After you finish creating the component, you can load the component into your app. See Load a Component in Your App.  ",

The interfaces define the methods and fields in Fire App Builder; the components implement the interfaces with fully developed code.To use the components, you don’t need to write your own Java code. You just need to customize various string values that have been extracted out of the code into XML files.The main interfaces include the following:  Ads Interface (IAds): Used for displaying ads to users  Analytics Interface (IAnalytics): Used for implementing analytics  Authentication Interface (IAuthentication): Used for authenticating or authorizing user access to media  Purchase Interface (IPurchase): Used for in-app purchasing  UAMP (UAMP): Used for playing mediaIf you need a component that isn’t available, you can create your own component that implements one of the interfaces.  Available Components and Interfaces  Authentication Components  Analytics Components  Ads Components  Purchasing Components  Media Player Components  UI ComponentsAvailable Components and InterfacesIn Android Studio, you won’t see all the components because the Fire App Builder sample app loads only a subset of the available components from the Fire App Builder library, as defined in your app’s Gradle files. Only one component from each interface is loaded.To view the available components on disk, you can browse (using Finder or File Explorer) to the folder on your computer where you downloaded the Fire App Builder project, or just refer to the information here.Authentication ComponentsAuthentication components allow you to identify and authorize users before they take an action in your app. You must have at least one authentication component loaded in your app. The authentication components implement the IAuthentication interface, which you can view in the AuthInterface folder. The following authentication components are available:                  Component      Description                  [AdobepassAuthComponent][fire-app-builder-adobe-pass-auth-component]&lt;/a&gt;      Uses Adobe Pass to authenticate users.

[LoginWithAmazon Component][fire-app-builder-login-with-amazon-component]&lt;/a&gt;      Uses Login with Amazon to authenticate users.              PassThroughLoginComponent      Used only if you don't want to use any other authentication component. Your app must load at least one authentication component loaded. This PassThrough Login Component component satisfies the authentication component requirement without affecting the user experience in your app.You can see the log messages triggered by the LoggerAnalytics component by searching for “passthroughlogin” in Logcat.      Analytics ComponentsAnalytics components track activities within your app and provide metrics for analysis. Analytics components implement the IAnalytics interface in the AnalyticsInterface folder. Loading an analytics component in your app is optional.                  Component      Description                  [FlurryAnalyticsComponent][fire-app-builder-flurry-analytics-component]&lt;/a&gt;      Uses Flurry Analytics to provide analytics.  By default, this component is loaded but not configured in the Fire App Builder sample app.              [OmnitureAnalyticsComponent][fire-app-builder-omniture-analytics-component]&lt;/a&gt;      Uses Omniture to provide analytics.

[GoogleAnalyticsComponent][fire-app-builder-google-analytics-component]      Uses Google Analytics to provide analytics.              LoggerAnalyticsComponent      The Logger Analytics Component is not intended to be used for actual analytics. Instead, this is a dummy analytics component that inserts log messages during events. If you’re not using any other analytics component, use Logger Analytics Component because at least one analytics component must be configured in your app. You can see the log messages triggered by the LoggerAnalytics component by searching for “loggeranalytics” in Logcat.      Ads ComponentsAds components refer to any components that show advertisements in your app. Ads components implement the IAds interface in the AnalyticsInterface folder. Loading an ads component in your app is required. The following ads components are available.                  Component      Description                  [FreeWheelAdsComponent][fire-app-builder-freewheel-ads-component]      Used for displaying Freewheel ads in your app.              [VastAdsComponent][fire-app-builder-vast-ads-component]      Used for displaying VAST ads in your app.              PassThroughAdsComponent      Used only if you don’t want to use any other ads component. Your app must load at least one ads component loaded. This PassThroughAds component satisfies the ads component requirement without affecting the user experience in your app.      If you don’t want to use any of the authentication components listed in the preceding table, use the PassThroughAdsComponent. Your app must have at least one ads component loaded. This dummy component satisfies the ads component requirements without affecting the user experience in your app.Purchasing ComponentsPurchasing components allow users to make payments to either rent or subscribe to content in your app. The purchasing components implement the IPurchase interface in the PurchaseInterface folder. Loading a purchasing component is required. If you don’t want this component active, however, you canThe following purchasing components are available.                  Component      Description                  [AmazonInAppPurchasingComponent][fire-app-builder-amazon-in-app-purchase-component]&lt;/a&gt;      Uses Amazon In-App Purchasing to allow users to choose Daily Pass (24-hour access) or Go Premium (subscription) to view the media in your app. This component is loaded by default but set as disabled and not configured.      Media Player ComponentsMedia Player components control the media player that is used for media playback in your app. The media components implement the UAMP interface in the UAMP folder. (UAMP stands for Universal Android Media Player.) Loading a media component is required. The following media player components are available.            Component      Description                  [AMZNMediaPlayerComponent][fire-app-builder-amazon-media-player-component]      Uses the Amazon Media Player, which is based on ExoPlayer. This component is loaded by default in Fire App Builder.              [BrightCoveMediaPlayerComponent][fire-app-builder-brightcove-media-player-component]      Uses the BrightCove media player. This is useful if your media is already tightly coupled with BrightCove.      UI ComponentsThe TVUIComponent isn’t an optional component, as it contains much of the user interface and functionality for the app (other than the media player features). It’s created as a component to allow for potentially adding additional UI components for other devices, such as tablets.",

        "content": "For an overview of the available components, see Components Overview. Although documentation for each component is specific, you load all components in the same way.  Remove a Component  Load a Component in Your App          1. Define and Compile the Component      2. Configure the Component’s Values      Remove a ComponentWith the exception of analytics components, you can load only one component per interface. For example, you cannot load both the VAST Ads component and the Freewheel Ads component, because both components use the same IAds interface.However, all components require you to have a component loaded in your app for that interface. Because of this requirement, some components are dummy components that simply fulfill the requirements of having a component. The following are dummy components:  LoggerAnalyticsComponent  PassThroughAdsComponentThese dummy components don’t do anything. For a list of the component interface groups, see Available Components and Interfaces in Components Overview.Before you load a component in your app, check to make sure you have only one component for that interface. If another component is already loaded (as is probably the case, even if it’s just a dummy component) you must remove it.To remove a component from your app, follow the same steps as listed in the next section, “Load a Component in Your App,” but do the opposite in each step. For example, instead of adding a reference to something like FacebookAuthComponent, you would remove the reference.Load a Component in Your AppTo load a component in your app:  1. Define and Compile the Component  2. Configure the Component’s Values1. Define and Compile the Component Note: These instructions assume you’re in the Android view.First you need to first define the implemented components in the “settings.gradle (Project Settings)” file:  In Android Studio, in the Android view, expand Gradle Scripts and open the settings.gradle (Project Settings) file. (This file appears near the bottom of the list.)      In the two Implementations sections, list the components that you want.    In settings.gradle (Project Settings), there are three places to list the components. The areas are identified through the /* Implementations */ comments, which are set off in red here:    include ':app',    /* Frameworks */    ':TVUIComponent',    ':UAMP',    /* Libraries */    ':ContentModel',    ':ContentBrowser',    ':DynamicParser',    ':DataLoader',    ':Utils',    /* Interfaces */    ':PurchaseInterface',    ':AuthInterface',    ':AdsInterface',    ':AnalyticsInterface',    ':ModuleInterface',    /* Implementations */    ':PassThroughAdsComponent',    ':AMZNMediaPlayerComponent',    ':FlurryAnalyticsComponent',    ':LoginWithAmazonComponent',    ':AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent'/* Frameworks */project(':TVUIComponent').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../TVUIComponent/lib')project(':UAMP').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../UAMP')/* Libraries */project(':ContentModel').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../ContentModel')project(':ContentBrowser').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../ContentBrowser')project(':DynamicParser').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../DynamicParser')project(':DataLoader').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../DataLoader')project(':Utils').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../Utils')/* Interfaces */project(':ModuleInterface').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../ModuleInterface')project(':AdsInterface').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../AdsInterface')project(':AuthInterface').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../AuthInterface')project(':AnalyticsInterface').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../AnalyticsInterface')project(':PurchaseInterface').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../PurchaseInterface')/* Implementations */project(':AMZNMediaPlayerComponent').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../AMZNMediaPlayerComponent')project(':PassThroughAdsComponent').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../PassThroughAdsComponent')project(':FlurryAnalyticsComponent').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../FlurryAnalyticsComponent')project(':FacebookAuthComponent').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../FacebookAuthComponent')project(':AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent')    Look in the source directory of the Fire App Builder project to get the exact directory names for each of the components, or just consult the names in the tables in the Components Overview. (Note that no component contains hyphens in the name. If hyphens appear, it’s because of a wrapping style.)    In the the sample app in Fire App Builder, the following components are implemented by default:          AMZNMediaPlayerComponent      PassThroughAdsComponent      FlurryAnalyticsComponent      FacebookAuthComponent      AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent            Adjust the implementations by adding or removing the components you want to use in your app. Be sure to make the updates in both places that /*Implementations*/ is mentioned.    For the component names, use the component folder name:          AdobepassAuthComponent      FacebookAuthComponent      LoginWithAmazonComponent      FlurryAnalyticsComponent      OmnitureAnalyticsComponent      CrashlyticsComponent      GoogleAnalyticsComponent      FreeWheelAdsComponent      VastAdsComponent      AmazonInAppPurchasingComponent      AMZNMediaPlayerComponent      BrightCoveMediaPlayerComponent            You can implement only one component per interface, so remove any previous components for the same interface.    For example, if you added the LoginWithAmazonComponent, which implements the IAuthentication interface, you must remove any other authentication components (such as AdobepassAuthComponent or FacebookAuthComponent).    Expand Gradle Scripts and open the build.gradle (Module: app) file.      In the dependencies object, include the components you want to include in your app.    By default, Fire App Builder shows these components:    compile project(':TVUIComponent')compile project(':UAMP')compile project(':AMZNMediaPlayerComponent')compile project(':PassThroughAdsComponent')compile project(':FlurryAnalyticsComponent')compile project(':FacebookAuthComponent')compile project(':AmazonInAppPurchaseComponent')        Add or remove the components you want to implement following the same pattern as before. Remember that you can implement only one component per interface, so remove any previous components for the same interface.    For example, if you added the LoginWithAmazonComponent, which implements the IAuthentication interface, you must remove any other authentication components (such as AdobepassAuthComponent or FacebookAuthComponent).        Resync your project with Gradle by clicking the Resync Project with Gradle Files button .    If you’re prompted that some modules are no longer imported from Gradle anymore, click OK.        When the project syncs, you will see the new components reflected in the Project pane.    Remove old build artifacts from previous components by going to Build &gt; Rebuild Project .2. Configure the Component’s ValuesEach component has a list of customizable strings that have been extracted out into an XML file. Because of this, to customize a component with your app, you merely need supply the right values for the strings. You don’t need to modify the Java classes.However, different components may require a little more setup than others, especially because they usually involve implementing and setting up a third-party service. Because of this, see the documentation for each component for the specifics of how to configure the component:  AdobepassAuthComponent  FacebookAuthComponent  LoginWithAmazonComponent  FlurryAnalyticsComponent  OmnitureAnalyticsComponent  CrashlyticsComponent  GoogleAnalyticsComponent  FreeWheelAdsComponent  VastAdsComponent  AmazonInAppPurchasingComponent  AMZNMediaPlayerComponent  BrightCoveMediaPlayerComponentThe strings that have been extracted for each component are the most common parameters only. If you need an additional feature within the component that hasn’t been extracted out into a string, you will need to customize it in the component’s class that implements the interface.The XML files for each component are usually located in the component’s res &gt; values folder.The most common values that you would need to customize for each component are extracted out into XML files. Note: Instead of customizing the values directly in the component’s files, copy the strings into your app’s custom.xml file instead. Any settings in your app’s custom.xml file will overwrite the XML file values in the components. This will allow you to incorporate updates to the component when new releases are available.",

        "content": "Fire App Builder provides a Java-based framework that you can use to easily and quickly build streaming media Android apps for Amazon Fire TV.Fire App Builder lets you build an engaging, high-quality media experience on Fire TV following best practices and techniques — without having to develop all the code yourself. Fire App Builder’s code is Java-based and uses Android Studio, Gradle, and other tools common to Android app development.Fire App Builder is released as an open source project on Github (github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder) under the Apache 2.0 license.  How You Work with Fire App Builder  Sample App from Fire App Builder  Who Fire App Builder Is For  Requirements to Work with Fire App Builder  Changing the App Appearance  Fire App Builder Features  Fire TV Terminology and Devices  Getting Started  Getting Updates to the Project  Getting Support  Noting Bugs or Feature RequestsHow You Work with Fire App BuilderWhen you create an app with Fire App Builder, you configure the settings for your data feed, screen layouts, and functionality through a series of JSON files. You also construct query syntax to get the categories and contents from your media feed.For authentication, ads, analytics, or in-app purchasing, you can use a variety of pluggable components that implement interfaces. To customize the look and feel of your app, including font, colors, logos, layouts, and other details, you simply update some values in XML or JSON files (rather than coding directly in Java).Overall, Fire App Builder allows you to quickly develop a high quality app without doing Java programming. If you want to extend Fire App Builder with more advanced functionality, you can use Fire App Builder as the underlying framework and build on top of it, since most of Fire App Builder’s components are modular.Sample App from Fire App BuilderFire App Builder contains a sample app (called “Application”) with a home screen that looks as follows:The home screen of the sample app built with Fire App Builder.The sample app in Fire App Builder contains a generic video feed from Lightcast that is used for testing purposes only.Who Fire App Builder Is ForFire App Builder is designed for companies with streaming media assets (similar to Netflix or Hulu) who want to make their content available online through Fire TV and other Android TV platforms. You would be a good fit if you have a video feed where your media assets (movies, shows, or other video content) are published.The media feed can be JSON or XML, but it must be its own feed rather than a Youtube or Vimeo channel. (If it’s XML, it can be a media RSS feed, such as what you submit to iTunes.) The feed can be in any structure — you’ll use query syntax to select the categories and contents from your feed.Additionally, Fire App Builder requires you to configure files using Android Studio, so it’s geared toward developer types who prefer to create their app using Java-based Android (instead of HTML5 web technologies). You can also build on top of the Fire App Builder framework to create more sophisticated apps. Essentially Fire App Builder is the Fire TV SDK for Android Java developers.If you’re more of a content creator instead of a coder, or you just want to build a Fire TV app for your Youtube videos, or if you’re not comfortable working in Android Studio with code (even though no programming skills are required), consider using the Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV instead.Requirements to Work with Fire App BuilderTo develop with Fire App Builder, you will need the following:  Android Studio. See Getting Started with Android Studio and Install Android Studio from the Android documentation for information about setting up the Android Studio development environment on your machine.  Java Development Kit (JDK) 8. You must have the Java SE Development Kit 8 or later on your computer.  Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. You will need to test your app on an actual Fire TV device — either the Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. (Although emulators are possible, they don’t always work and aren’t supported for Fire TV development.) The Fire TV has better performance, so if your media is resource intensive, you’ll want to be sure it plays well on the Fire TV Stick too. (Note that Fire TV does not come with an HDMI cable, so you will need to supply that cable to connect the Fire TV box to your TV.)  Television with HDMI port. You will need a television with an HDMI port that your Fire TV can connect to.  A-to-A USB cable. If you’re using Fire TV (not the stick) and connecting your computer to Fire TV through USB (instead of through a wireless network), you will need an A-to-A USB cable. Instead of using a cable, you can also connect to Fire TV devices through a network. (See Connecting to Fire TV Through ADB.)  Media feed with necessary elements. You will need a media feed (in either JSON or XML format) with video assets as well as the following feed elements: title, ID, description, URL, card image, background image. (The same image can be used for both the card and background.) Any video format supported by Exoplayer is compatible with Fire App Builder.Changing the App AppearanceWhen you build your app, you can customize the look and feel by changing colors, fonts, and images. To customize the images, you will need at least the following image assets: logo, splash screen logo, and app icon.More customization is possible, including the layout. See Customize the Look and Feel of Your App for details.Fire App Builder FeaturesFire App Builder provides the following features:  Five screens: Splash screen, Home (two layouts), Content Details, Content Renderer, and Search.  Search functionality and search results: Text search within your app. Also includes intent filters to integrate with the global Fire TV search if your media is integrated into the Fire TV catalog.  Exoplayer-based Amazon Media Player for streaming media: The media player includes closed captions, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), bandwidth settings, and more.  Components for ads, analytics, authorization, and in-app purchasing: More than 10 components that you can easily plug into your app and configure through XML files. Some of these components include Amazon in-app purchases, Login with Amazon, Facebook Login, Omniture Analytics, Flurry Analytics, Adobe Pass Authentication, Freewheel ads, and VAST 2.0 ads.Fire TV Terminology and Devices“Fire TV” refers to the Fire TV box, while “Fire TV Stick” refers to the stick version.You can compare the specifications across devices at Fire TV Device Specifications. The Fire TV has more power and faster performance, but the two devices run the same Fire OS and are more or less identical from an end-user’s perspective. Each device has two generations — Generation 2 is the latest.Fire TV also optionally comes in a Gaming Edition. You can also buy a game controller on its own and use it with Fire TV stick. Fire TV Stick (Generation 2) includes the voice remote by default, whereas Fire TV Stick (Generation 1) optionally provided the voice remote.Getting StartedTo get started building an app with Fire App Builder, see Beginning-to-End Process for Building an App with Fire App Builder, which lists the steps needed to develop an app with Fire App Builder.As you follow the instructions in the documentation, note that it’s usually assumed that you’re working in the Android view in Android Studio. If you don’t see a certain folder or path, check the view you’re in.Also, you can find any file by clicking Shift twice and then typing the file name. When you load the file, the path to the file appears just below the row of buttons on the top navigation bar.Getting Updates to the ProjectYou can get updates to the application by watching the Fire App Builder Github repository and running a git pull command to get the latest updates. See Pull Updates from Github for more details.Getting SupportIf you have feedback or questions about Fire App Builder, you can get support through the Fire TV Amazon forums.Noting Bugs or Feature RequestsTo note bugs or make feature requests, you can do so through the Issues tab on the Fire App Builder Github repository. Or you can submit the info to the Fire TV Amazon forums.",

      "fire-app-builder-questions-and-answers-html": {
        "title": "Miscellaneous Questions",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The following are common questions about Fire App Builder.  Do apps created with Fire App Builder work on smartphone devices and tablets too, or just TV?  Currently, apps built with Fire App Builder work only on Fire TV and other Android TV platforms. A future enhancement will allow apps built with Fire App Builder to work on other devices as well. This is why the toolkit’s name is “Fire App Builder” and not “Fire TV App Builder.”  What kind of TVs do users need to have to use Fire TV?  Users need a TV with an HDMI port.  How can I implement Google Ads?  You can implement Google ads through the VAST Component, which supports Google ads.  Does Fire App Builder support live feeds?  Yes, you can display any media from your feed. As long as your feed has valid media (live or pre-recorded), it can be played through your app built with Fire App Builder. See Configure Live Streams.  Do I need an actual Fire TV device to develop my app?  Using an actual device during development and testing is highly recommended, but you can also use an emulator with some limitations.  What’s the difference between Fire App Builder and Web Application Starter Kit (WASK)?  Fire App Builder uses Java with Android to create native Java apps, with Android Studio as your IDE. Fire App Builder is intended more for developers who want to build robust streaming media apps (without doing all the programming). WASK is a mobile web app toolkit (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript instead of Java), intended more towards content creators than developers.  Can I submit an app built with Fire App Builder to Google’s Play Store as well as Amazon’s Appstore?  Yes, since both app stores play Android apps, apps built with Fire App Builder work on both the Amazon Appstore and Google Play Store. However, services unique to Amazon or Google will only work in the respective platforms.  How do I use reflection rather than translation when Fire App Builder maps the objects in my feed to its content model?  Reflection is actually used by default, so if you want to select this approach, remove the translator parameter from the categories recipe and the contents recipe.    Additionally, when you configure the matchlist parameter with your recipes, you must map your feed element names to slightly different names. Instead of using @title, @subtitle, @id, @description, @url, @cardImageUrl, @backgroundImageUrl, and @tags, put an “m” before each word and then follow camelcase styling. Specifically, use the following: @mTitle, @mSubtitle, @mId, @description, @mUrl, @mCardImageUrl, @mBackgroundImageUrl, and @mTags.    How can I enable the CEA-608 captions that are available in my HLS live stream?  No, Fire App Builder does not support CEA-608. Fire App Builder passes the responsibility to render captions to AMZNMediaPlayer, which supports CEA-608 (see the relevant code lines here). However, Fire App Builder only does so for vtt and xml extensions. CEA captions have a m3u8 extension, so Fire App Builder ignores this extension and does not inform AMZNMediaPlayer to render the captions.",

        "content": "Version 1.0.0FeaturesThe first release of Fire App Builder was published to Github on October 1, 2016. The first release includes a fully functional Java-based Android TV app that can parse media feeds and play media.The app includes more than a dozen components that allow you to quickly add analytics, in-app purchasing, ads, and media player components in your app. You can also customize the look and feel of your app, including the font, images, colors, and layout, by setting values in XML and JSON files.Known Issues  Facebook Authentication Component. With the Facebook Authentication Component, if users choose “Log in Later” when prompted by the Facebook Authentication Component, they are never asked about logging in later. (Users should be re-prompted after a period of time.)  Recommended Content. Recommended content matches (which are based on tags in the feed) will match unlimited content if many items have the same tags. (The content matches should have an item limit.)  In-App Purchasing Component. With the In-App Purchasing Component, purchases made on other devices won’t be acknowledged in the app until a user either restarts the app or attempts to play the content. (The app should refresh purchased items when the state goes to the background.)  Splash screen. Loading the feed initially can take some time on splash screen. (The initial load time should be faster.)",

        "content": "When users press the microphone button on a voice-enabled remote, regardless of where users are in Fire TV, this action initiates a global search using the Alexa cloud service (instead of the Leanback library in your app).  Media Requests Through Voice  a. Integrate Your App’s Media with Fire TV Catalog  b. Include a Content ID in Your Feed and Catalog Submission  Configure Your App to Listen for Broadcast Intents  Testing Catalog IntegrationMedia Requests Through VoiceMedia requests through voice (such as saying the TV show you want to watch) always return content from the Fire TV catalog. The search within the catalog takes place in the cloud, not in your app.You can learn more about how search is implemented on Fire TV here. To learn more about Alexa voice capabilities on Fire TV from an end-user’s perspective, see Alexa on Fire TV.If you want your app’s media to appear in these global search results, you must integrate your app’s media into the Fire TV catalog. The Fire TV catalog contains an index of all media content on Fire TV.The process of getting your app’s content into the catalog is called “catalog integration.” Catalog integration involves regularly pushing your content to the catalog service (the catalog service does not read from a feed). This is a task a developer will need to configure — Fire App Builder does not do catalog integration for you. You can learn more about Fire TV catalog integration here.)When a search is initiated, Fire TV sends your app a broadcast for an intent. An intent (short for “intention”) is a message for your app to perform a desired action. Your app must have an intent filter declared in its manifest file that listens for this intent and then acts on it. (You can learn about intent filters in Android’s documentation.) Fire App Builder does have the code that allows your app to listen for the broadcast intents – it just needs to be uncommented when you’re ready to start listening for the intents. (See Configure Your App to Listen for Broadcast Intents below.After you integrate your media into the Fire TV catalog and configure your app’s manifest with intent filtering, if users already have your app installed, your app’s content will appear directly in the search results. If a user doesn’t have your app, a “More Ways to Watch” option appears for users to get your app and view the content.a. Integrate Your App’s Media with Fire TV CatalogFor instructions getting your app’s media into the Fire TV Catalog, see Integrating Your Catalog with Fire TV.The Fire App Builder project has already completed the steps described in Integrating Your App with the Fire TV Home Screen Launcher. You just need to uncomment some code in manifest files as described in the following section.b. Include a Content ID in Your Feed and Catalog SubmissionYour catalog details must have a unique ID for each content item. This unique content ID must correspond with the content IDs in your media feed. If your media feed does not contain unique IDs for each media content item, you must add it.Additionally, your catalog details in the cloud and your media feed (as integrated into your app) must always be in sync.Configure Your App to Listen for Broadcast IntentsTo make your app listen for broadcast intents:  In your app’s folder in Android Studio, expand manifests, open AndroidManifest.xml.      Uncomment the “Launcher Integration intents” section:    &lt;!-- Launcher integration intents --&gt;&lt;!-- Uncomment the below intent filters to enable launcher integration --&gt;    &lt;intent-filter&gt;    &lt;action android:name=\"PLAY_CONTENT_FROM_LAUNCHER\"/&gt;    &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\"/&gt;&lt;/intent-filter&gt;&lt;intent-filter&gt;    &lt;action android:name=\"SIGN_IN_FROM_LAUNCHER\"/&gt;    &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\"/&gt;&lt;/intent-filter&gt;        Go to ContentBrowser &gt; manifests and open the AndroidManifest.xml file.

More details about launcher integration testing are available in Integrating Your App with the Fire TV Home Screen Launcher. Specifically, see the section “Step 6: Test Your Launcher Integration.” To enable this testing for your unpublished app:  Go to ContentBrowser &gt; java &gt; com.amazon.android.contentbrowser &gt; helper and open LauncherIntegrationManager.java.

        "content": "If users watch live content and then return to the content details page, two buttons appear: “Watch Now” and “Watch from Beginning”:However, with live content, you only want the “Watch Now” button even when users return to the content, because live content can’t be rewound to the beginning.  Removing the “Watch from Beginning” button for Live Content          Option 1: Remove the Button Through Navigator.json      Option 2: Remove the Button by Matching a Value in the Feed      Removing the “Watch from Beginning” button for Live ContentTo remove the “Watch from Beginning” button for live content, you have two options:  Option 1: Remove the Button Through Navigator.json: Use this approach if all the media within a specific recipe configuration is live content, and you don’t have any tags within your feed that identify the content as live.  Option 2: Remove the Button by Matching a Value in the Feed: Use this approach if only some of the content in your feed is live streamed, and your feed has tags that identify the content that is live.Option 1: Remove the Button Through Navigator.json  Open the Navigator.json file (in app &gt; assets).      Within the categories object that contains recipes for your live feed, add a recipeConfig object with a liveContent parameter set to true. Here’s an example that shows some context:        {      \"categories\": {        \"name\": \"Hardcoded Category Name\"      },      \"contents\": {        \"dataLoader\": \"recipes/LightCastDataLoaderRecipe1.json\",        \"dynamicParser\": \"recipes/LightCastAllContentsRecipe.json\"      },      \"recipeConfig\": {        \"liveContent\": true      }    }  ],  \"graph\": {    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.SplashActivity\": {      \"verifyScreenAccess\": false,      \"verifyNetworkConnection\": true,      \"onAction\": \"CONTENT_SPLASH_SCREEN\"    },    \"com.amazon.android.tv.tenfoot.ui.activities.ContentBrowseActivity\": {  Now for this recipe (LightCastAllContentsRecipe in the above code sample), the “Watch from Beginning” button won’t be shown when users return to the media after previously watching it.Option 2: Remove the Button by Matching a Value in the FeedIf your media feed includes tags that identify media as live content, you can configure the matchList parameter to identify these tags when you configure your Contents recipe.For example, suppose an item in your feed looks like this, with the &lt;live&gt;true&lt;/live&gt; tag:&lt;item&gt;  &lt;id&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;  &lt;title&gt;Nullamtus&lt;/title&gt;  &lt;link&gt;http://www.developer.amazon.com/&lt;/link&gt;  &lt;pubdate&gt;Wed, 14 Jan 2015 00:36:00 +0000&lt;/pubdate&gt;  &lt;description&gt;Sed a sagittis urna, a fermentum ligula.

Getting Updates  Resolving Merge Conflicts  Git ResourcesGetting UpdatesWhen new versions of Fire App Builder are released and pushed out to Github, you can get the new version’s updates and integrate the code into your project using the common git pull technique used with Github workflows.First change to your fire-app-builder directory (or whatever you’ve named it). Then pull the latest changes into your repository:cd fire-app-buildergit pullWhen you run a git pull command, git downloads the latest updates from the original repository and attempts to merge the updates into your code.Resolving Merge ConflictsIf changes in the original repository’s files conflict with changes you’ve made to your local copy, git will not automatically overwrite your local copies with the updates. Instead, git will show you merge conflicts for the affected files and remove the affected files from its tracking. You will then need to resolve the merge conflicts, add the files back into git tracking, and commit your update.After you run git pull, if you see merge conflicts, pen the files with merge conflicts. Carrots (»»») and («««) indicate areas where conflicts occur. Manually edit the files to remove the carrots. Then add the file back into git tracking with git add &lt;filename&gt;, where  is the name of the file you're adding back in.See Resolving a merge conflict from the command line for details on how to resolve merge conflicts.Git ResourcesHere are some good resources for learning git:  git’s documentation  git - the simple guide  git Tutorials from Atlassian",

      "fire-app-builder-querying-json-html": {
        "title": "Querying JSON",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "When you set up your recipes, you used Jayway JsonPath syntax for the query parameter. You can learn more about the JSON query syntax here: Jayway JsonPath.To get a better sense of how the query syntax words, you can use the Jayway JsonPath Evaluator. Specifically, see the Operators section to understand how the various syntax ($, @, *, .., .&lt;name&gt;, [?(&lt;expression&gt;)]) targets specific elements in your JSON.The following sections provide examples about how to construct Jayway JsonPath queries.  JSON Path Query Example 1  JSON Path Query Example 2  JSON Path Query Example 3  Example 4JSON Path Query Example 1In this example, we’ll step through some Jayway JsonPath queries in more detail.  Open the urlFile.json (in app &gt; assets).      Copy the first URL:    http://www.lightcast.com/api/firetv/channels.php?app_id=257&amp;app_key=0ojbgtfcsq12&amp;action=channels_videos        Paste this URL into a browser and press Return to see the contents.  Copy the contents and prettify the JSON using a tool such as jsonprettyprint.com.  Copy the prettified JSON and paste it into the Jayway JsonPath Evaluator.      In the Go! box, enter the query to get all categories:    $..categories[*]            Click Go!    The result shows all the categories from the feed.    [   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Underwater\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Attractions\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Attractions\",   \"Bahamas Underwater\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Attractions\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Attractions\",   \"Bahamas Weddings\",   \"Bahamas Weddings\",   \"Bahamas Attractions\",   \"Bahamas Underwater\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Attractions\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Weddings\",   \"Bahamas Islands\",   \"Bahamas Underwater\"]        With this particular feed, each media object lists its category, so the query shows numerous “Bahamas Islands” results (one for each media object containing this category).    Extracting all categories from a feed using Jayway JsonPath query syntax.    The syntax $..categories[*] means to start in the root directory ($) and look in all subdirectories (..) for the key categories. This key must contain an array ([]), but the array can containing anything (*).    If you were to switch the query to $..title[*], nothing would match because title isn’t a key containing an array in the feed. To retrieve all titles, you would use $..title.    The DynamicParser class in the Fire App Builder code will remove duplicates when putting these categories into a map.     Tip: See the Path Examples in the JsonPath documentation to get a better sense of the variety of queries you can use to target specific elements in your feed.  JSON Path Query Example 2Here’s another potential feed structure for media:{     \"total\":\"13\",   \"results\":[        {           \"id\":\"45454333\",         \"title\":\"'Sample video title1\",         \"link\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/assets\\/some\\/media\\/path\\/myvideo1.mp4\",         \"pubDate\":\"Tue, 01 Oct 2016 18:29:52 +0530\",         \"media:thumbnail\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/assets\\/some\\/someimage1.jpg\",         \"media:duration\":\"1913\",         \"description\":\"This is a sample description1\",         \"media:filepath\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/videos\\/1234\\/myvideo1.mp4\",         \"media:fullimage\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/videos\\/1234\\/thumbnail1.jpg\",         \"media:keywords\":\"some, sample, keywords,random\"      },      {           \"id\":\"44545333\",         \"title\":\"'Sample video title 2\",         \"link\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/assets\\/some\\/media\\/path\\/myvideo2.mp4\",         \"pubDate\":\"Tue, 01 Sep 2016 18:29:52 +0530\",         \"media:thumbnail\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/assets\\/some\\/someimage2.jpg\",         \"media:duration\":\"1945\",         \"description\":\"This is a sample description 2\",         \"media:filepath\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/videos\\/1234\\/myvideo2.mp4\",         \"media:fullimage\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/videos\\/1234\\/thumbnail2.jpg\",         \"media:keywords\":\"some, sample, keywords,random\"      },           {           \"id\":\"4543434333\",         \"title\":\"'Sample video title3\",         \"link\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/assets\\/some\\/media\\/path\\/myvideo3.mp4\",         \"pubDate\":\"Tue, 01 Aug 2016 18:29:52 +0530\",         \"media:thumbnail\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/assets\\/some\\/someimage3.jpg\",         \"media:duration\":\"1955\",         \"description\":\"This is a sample description\",         \"media:filepath\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/videos\\/1234\\/myvideo3.mp4\",         \"media:fullimage\":\"http:\\/\\/example.com\\/videos\\/1234\\/thumbnail3.jpg\",         \"media:keywords\":\"some, sample, keywords,random\"      }         ]}Let’s say you wanted to select the media:thumbnail values for all the items. You could use this syntax:$..results[*].media:thumbnailThis syntax says to start at the root, look recursively in all the items, match everything within the results array, and select the media:thumbnail element.

        "content": "When you set up your recipes, you used XML query syntax for the query parameter. XML queries use XPath expressions. You can learn more about the XPath syntax here. You can also test out your XPath expressions using this XPath Tester / Evaluator.Once you get the result from XPath, you use matchList selectors to select specific elements in the query result. The matchList selectors don’t use XPath syntax but rather a custom Amazon syntax to target the right elements. The purpose of the matchList selector is to correlate an element in your feed with the Fire App Builder content model so that the right item can be displayed in the Fire App Builder UI.The examples on this page demonstrate a variety of both XPath queries and matchList selectors. In each example, first a query is used to target specific elements from your feed. Then a matchList parameter is used to select the elements from the query’s returns.With the matchList parameter, there’s not an evaluator (as there is with XPath) where you can plug in the syntax and see the result. The only way is to look at how your app builds in Android Studio.

        "content": "When you develop your app with Fire App Builder, you should use an actual Fire TV device to test your app. See Connecting to Fire TV Through ADB for details. However, if you’re in a situation where you can only use an emulator, you can get by if you accept some limitations with the emulator. The emulator will work, but you can’t click the media player buttons with your mouse.Mouse clicks generate motion events, which aren’t supported by media played in Fire App Builder (you’ll see an error in logcat that says “java.lang.ClassCastException: android.view.MotionEvent cannot be cast to android.view.KeyEvent”). As a result, the app will crash on the emulator if you use your mouse to click the media player’s buttons.Instead of using your mouse on the media playback screen, to return to the previous screen after playing media, click the Back button on the right of the emulator (as indicated by the arrow in the following screenshot).Don’t click the media player’s buttons with your mouse. Outside of media playback, you can use your mouse to click wherever you want.To configure an emulator:When you configure the Android TV emulator, you must select at least API Level 23 or 24. You have flexibility with the other settings (resolution, size, and so on). (If you choose API Level 24, you’ll be prompted to install Instant Run, which is a requirement for this API level.)To set up an Android TV emulator for your app:  Go to Tools &gt; Android &gt; AVD Manager, or click the AVD Manager button  on the top navigation bar.      Click the + Create Virtual Device button.     Note: You can select one of the default TV profiles, or you can customize the settings by following the steps below. If you select a default TV profile, skip ahead to step 12 where you select a system image.    In the Category column, select TV.  Click the New Hardware Profile button.  In the Device Name, type something like fire_tv_emulator. (Avoid using parentheses in the name, as this may cause errors.)  For the Device Type, select Android TV.  For the Screen size, type the screen size you want (for example, 40).  For the Resolution, type the resolution you want (for example, 1280 x 720).  For the Supported device states, select only Landscape (clear the Portrait check box).  Click Finish.  In the “Choose a device definition” dialog box, select the emulator you just created and click Next.  In the Release Name column, select at least Marshmallow API Level 23 or higher. If you haven’t downloaded this system image yet, click Download to download it. (If you select API Level 22 or lower, media playback will fail in the emulator.)  Click Next and then click Finish.The emulator is now listed as an option in your virtual devices. Note: If you chose a default TV profile, you must rename the device to remove any parentheses in the name. These parentheses cause an error when you run your app. (You’ll see an error that says the \"virtual device name contains invalid characters.\") To rename your virtual device, while viewing your virtual devices, click the Edit button  under the Actions column on the right. Then rename the device.Run your app by clicking the Run ‘app’ button . Select the virtual device you created:Now you can use the emulator as usual. Just be careful when you play media. When you play media, don’t click the buttons on the media player with your mouse. Instead, either use your keys or use the buttons to the right of the emulator as shown in the earlier screenshot.",
