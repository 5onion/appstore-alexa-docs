This topic provides a dictionary of the elements available in the Catalog Data Format (CDF) schema, used to construct a catalog of your media content for upload to Amazon Fire TV.
>>>>>>> tomunreleased

For an overview of the structure of a CDF catalog file and how these elements interact, see [About the Catalog Data Format (CDF)][about-the-cdf] The catalog examples in the downloadable [cdf-examples.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.amazon.aftb.cdf/cdf-examples.zip) file also can be very useful in understanding how a catalog file is put together. Download [catalog.xsd](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.amazon.aftb.cdf/catalog.xsd) to examine the XSD directly.

To use this information, readers should have a good understanding of XML. The following sections list the CDF schema element definitions.

## Genre {#Genre}

The genre of the work, such as comedy, horror, drama, or documentary. A work can be described through multiple Genre elements if necessary. For optimized search and matching, attempt to use standard genre descriptions. Use multiple Genre tags rather than combine several descriptions into a single string.

**Required if the optional Genres element is present:**

| Added | CDF version 1.0 | | |
| Parent Elements | [Movie](#Genres) | | |
| Child Elements | None | | |
| Attributes |  | |
| | Attribute | Accepted Values | Description |
| | locale | Standard XML/HTML language codes, such as en, en-US, fr, or fr-FR | **Required**. The device or software's language setting under which to use this string. |
| | pronunciation | String | **Optional**. Used when the element's text is given in kanji. The expected sort order in Japanese is based on pronunciation (which cannot be determined from the kanji) rather than characters. The _pronunciation_ attribute provides that information, typically using hiragana. |

**Example:**

```xml
<Genres>
  <Genre locale="en-US">horror</Genre>
  <Genre locale="en-US">sci-fi</Genre>
</Genres>

* * *

## Genres {#Genres}

Contains one or more [Genre](#Genre) tags used to describe the category of the work, such as comedy, horror, or documentary.

</Genres>
```

* * *

## ID {#ID}

An identifier string for a work. This value must be at least one character long and unique among all other IDs in your catalog. Two works with the same ID will cause your catalog to be rejected by the ingestion system. Devise an ID scheme and use it unfailingly to avoid duplicate IDs. For instance, you could use your Partner ID + the work type + a long identifier such as a GUID, for an ID such as `AmazonStudios_ Movie_01152ce2-de7e-44c1-9736-e8f3b15a1ddf`. Any scheme that assures unique IDs within your catalog is valid.

When you update an existing catalog, the IDs for your works should not change. If an ID disappears from your catalog, we assume that work is no longer available on your service and remove it from our index.

**Required:**

| Added | CDF version 1.0 |
| Parent Elements | [Movie](#Movie), [TvShow](#TvShow), [TvSeason](#TvSeason), [TvEpisode](#TvEpisode), [TvSpecial](#TvSpecial), [MiniSeries](#MiniSeries), [MiniSeriesEpisode](#MiniSeriesEpisode), [Extra](#Extra) |
| Child Elements | None |
| Attributes | None |

**Example:**

```xml
<Movie>
  <ID>AmazonStudios_Movie_01152ce2-de7e-44c1-9736-e8f3b15a1ddf</ID>
  ...
</Movie>
```

* * *

## ImageUrl {#ImageUrl}

The URL of an image that represents the work, sometimes called the "box art." Each work can contain only a single ImageUrl element. If you don't include ImageUrl, we attempt to use available art from other sources such as IMDb, or we might use a generic placeholder image. See [About the CDF][about-the-cdf] for image requirements.

{% include note.html content="Provide a unique image for each work that applies to the work's content. Do not use a generic placeholder image, such as a logo." %}

**Optional (see Comments):**

| Added | CDF version 1.0 |
| Parent Elements | [Movie](#Movie), [TvShow](#TvShow), [TvSeason](#TvSeason), [TvEpisode](#TvEpisode), [TvSpecial](#TvSpecial), [MiniSeries](#MiniSeries), [MiniSeriesEpisode](#MiniSeriesEpisode), [Extra](#Extra) |
| Child Elements | None |
| Attributes | None |
| Comments | Any one given ImageUrl element is optional, but at least 50% of your entries must include it and the image it points to must be valid. If more than 50% of the images in your file are determined to be invalid (and simply not having an image is considered an invalidity), your uploaded catalog will be rejected by the ingestion system. An image also helps us in matching this work with the same work from other providers, which improves the customer search experience by bundling all offers for the work into a single search result. That, in turn, improves the discoverability of your particular offer. See [About the CDF][about-the-cdf] for image size and height-to-width ratio requirements. |

**Example:**

```xml
<TvShow>
  ...
  <ImageUrl>http://amazon.com/images/01152ce2de7e44c1/image.jpg</ImageUrl>
  ...
</TvShow>
```

| | pronunciation | String | **Optional**. Used when the element's text is given in kanji. The expected sort order in Japanese is based on pronunciation (which cannot be determined from the kanji) rather than characters. The _pronunciation_ attribute provides that information, typically using hiragana. |

**Example:**
