### Fire TV User Interface Update

Fire TV Gen 2 devices received an update to the interface. The update provides a more cinematic experience that
offers video trailers and content screenshots to help customers access the content they want more quickly. Third-party apps are also more visible on the homepage in recommended rows. Accessibility improvements were included that allow customers to use Fire TV and any compatible apps with the VoiceView screen reader. (See the [original announcement](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2206525).)

To upload the new Fire TV assets required for the new UI, see the instruction in [Image Asset Guidelines for Appstore Submission](/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/asset-guidelines-for-app-submission#firetvassets). The user interface update will be applied to generation 1 devices in a later phase.

### Fire App Builder

[Fire App Builder][fire-app-builder-overview] was released on September 29, 2016. Fire App Builder provides a Java-based framework that you can use to easily and quickly build streaming media Android apps for Amazon Fire TV. Fire App Builder lets you build an engaging, high-quality media experience on Fire TV following best practices and techniques — without having to develop all the code yourself. Fire App Builder’s code is Java-based and uses Android Studio, Gradle, and other tools common to Android app development. Fire App Builder is released as an open source project on Github ([github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder](github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder)) under the Apache 2.0 license.
