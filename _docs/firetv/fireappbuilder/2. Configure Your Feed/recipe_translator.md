Specifies whether translation or reflection is used when converting your feed's objects to the Fire App Builder content model. Translation is faster and recommended. To use translation, simply leave the value at the default: {{include.default_value}}. If you want to use reflection instead, remove the `translator` parameter altogether from the recipe. Also see the "How do I use reflection..." question in the [FAQ][fire-app-builder-questions-and-answers#translator], because using reflection will require a change in the names used in the `matchlist` parameter.
