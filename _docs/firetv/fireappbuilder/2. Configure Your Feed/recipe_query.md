A query used to return {{include.type}} from your media feed. The syntax of the query depends on the structure of your feed. You will need to construct the right query to **get your {{include.type}}**. For JSON feeds, use [Jayway JsonPath syntax](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath) for the query syntax. For XML feeds, use [XPath expressions](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) for the query syntax. See [query Parameter](#queryparameter) below for more details.
