Entitlement represents a one-time purchase to unlock access to features or content within an app or game.

## Entitled Content Overview? 

Entitled content includes any type of content that you sell within your app that requires access rights. This type of content is available anywhere the customer is logged into the Amazon Client. The entitled content does not expire. If Amazon needs to rescind the entitled content, your app will be notified via an observable event.

Customers purchase a specific entitlement only once. The entitled content is granted to the customer's Amazon account. That entitled content is used to access the content from any eligible device the customer has linked to their account.

Entitled content typically include items such as:

*   Additional levels for a game
*   Access to a previously purchased item like a magazine issue
*   Unlocking functionality already in your app

The PurchasingManager grants the entitlement; you do not have to do anything outside of initiating the purchase. Through the PurchasingManager you can retrieve purchase data and revoked entitlements to determine if a customer has an entitlement for a specific SKU.

## Sample Implementation

The following sample code is an excerpt of the Button Clicker Sample App showing the relevant logic for integrating entitled content. In the app, button colors are purchasable entitled content items. The complete app and source code is provided as part of the Amazon Web App Resources.
