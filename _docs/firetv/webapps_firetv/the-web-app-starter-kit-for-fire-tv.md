The Web App Starter Kit for Fire TV, available on Github at [github.com/amzn/web-app-starter-kit-for-fire-tv](https://github.com/amzn/web-app-starter-kit-for-fire-tv), includes the Fire TV web app template and associated text files. The Fire TV web app template is both an illustration of best practices for developing a web app for Fire TV and a starting point for developing your own web app.

## Working with WASK

You can easily create your own app by replacing sections of code in the template with your code, making the tweaks your app requires, and using your own data sources.

The template is an app that displays movies in different categories. These categories are displayed vertically in the left-hand navigation pane, and the movies in each category appear in a horizontal row to the right of the category.

The user can navigate up and down the left-hand navigation pane or move to one of the rows and navigate back and forth in the row. The user can also select one of the movies in a row to see details about that movie.

Although the items in the template are movies, the same format and techniques can be used for almost any sort of items.  

The template incorporates good design for Fire TV web apps, optimized user experience, and handling input from the Amazon Fire TV Remote. For more information on Fire TV design guidelines, see [Design and User Experience Guidelines][design-and-user-experience-guidelines].

 For more information on handling controller input, see [Getting Started with Web Apps for Fire TV][getting-started-with-web-apps-for-fire-tv].
